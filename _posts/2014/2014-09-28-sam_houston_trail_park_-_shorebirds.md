Thanks to recent mowing, I was able to access the west-side of the pond at Sam
Houston Trail Park in Irving, TX this morning. The pond is drying up &mdash;
creating a wonderful concentration of aquatic creatures for the the shorebirds
to eat. These photos are as good as I can do. Positively identified:

<ul>
<li>American Avocet</li>
<li>Snowy Egret</li>
<li>Least Sandpiper</li>
<li>Stilt Sandpiper (pretty sure, not absolutely sure)</li>
<li>Greater Yellowlegs</li>
<li>Northern Shoveler</li>
<li>Killdeer</li>
</ul>

I encountered a few more common birds, and just as I was leaving ran into a
group of three Lark Sparrows to cap off the muddy morning.
