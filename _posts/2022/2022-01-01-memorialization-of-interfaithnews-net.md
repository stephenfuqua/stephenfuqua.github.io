> "Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
> sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement has
> sprung from the grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net
> (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive
> interfaith and religious news, events, and resources."

That was the mission of a little newsletter and website that Joel Beversluis and
I started, with support from the [North American Interfaith
Network](http://nain.org) (NAIN) and the [United Religions
Initiative](https://www.uri.org) (URI), in 2002. Would that I could remember
where he and I first met; perhaps at the URI North America summit of 2001 [in
Salt Lake
City](https://www.deseret.com/2001/6/2/19589287/bishop-striving-to-put-an-end-to-religionism).
Regardless, our time of collaboration was all too short.

By winter of 2002, he dropped out of contact; I was only to learn why when I
heard of his passing in March of 2003: cancer. He left behind a grieving family,
friends, and countless acquaintances. Those of us who knew him from interfaith
work were inspired by his dedication to publishing and distributing books and
articles that promoted inter-religious co-existence; the [Sourcebook of the
World's
Religions](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AJoel+Beversluis&s=relevancerank&text=Joel+Beversluis&ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1)
remains a magnum opus with its broad coverage of religions primarily
_from the voices of practitioners_.

What could I do but carry on? Though I did not have his media resources or
contact network, for four more years I tried to continue this legacy. From time
to time I would have editorial help from a few other collaborators, but I did
not know how to nurture those relationships and was all too used to going it
alone. So I would mine the URI and NAIN mailing lists, [Worldwide Faith
News](https://www.wfn.org/), [Religion News Service](https://religionnews.com/),
and other sources for whatever material I could find that was _interfaith /
inter-religious_ and (generally) represented _cooperation and dialogue_, rather
than animosity and division.

By the summer of 2006 my responsibilities in the local Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;
community had increased and my time for interfaith work consequently diminished.
Thus the October, 2006 electronic newsletter was the last. There was one more
article in 2007, and at some point I stopped paying for the hosting service. And
made a big mistake: I didn't save an archive, or if I did, I lost it during some
transfer from one hard drive to another.

Fast forward: some muse breathed into me a desire to look through the site
again. And so in 2021 I began to recover the site. Not a
resurrection: no new life breathed into it. Just a memorialization, a
museum-ification, of what had once been an important part of my avocational
life. This required significant trawling through the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), digging up as much as I could find. And then reformatting, because the HTML was often corrupted, and the captured pages
were from different eras with different styles.

At last, in time for 2022, the memorial is complete:

The third design looked much like the current memorial design at the top of the page.
