> "Reacting to religious fanaticism and the challenges of advancing and
> sustaining a more equitable civilization, a global interfaith movement has
> sprung from the grassroots of religion and spirituality. InterfaithNews.Net
> (INN) seeks to chronicle this movement by focusing primarily on positive
> interfaith and religious news, events, and resources."

That was the mission of a little newsletter and website that Joel Beversluis and
I started, with support from the [North American Interfaith
Network](http://nain.org) (NAIN) and the [United Religions
Initiative](https://www.uri.org) (URI), in 2002. Would that I could remember
where he and I first met; perhaps at the URI North America summit of 2001 [in
Salt Lake
City](https://www.deseret.com/2001/6/2/19589287/bishop-striving-to-put-an-end-to-religionism).
Regardless, our time of collaboration was all too short.

By winter of 2002, he dropped out of contact; I was only to learn why when I
heard of his passing in March of 2003: cancer. He left behind a grieving family,
friends, and countless acquaintances. Those of us who knew him from interfaith
work were inspired by his dedication to publishing and distributing books and
articles that promoted inter-religious co-existence; the [Sourcebook of the
World's
Religions](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AJoel+Beversluis&s=relevancerank&text=Joel+Beversluis&ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1)
remains a magnum opus with its broad coverage of religions primarily
_from the voices of practitioners_.

What could I do but carry on? Though I did not have his media resources or
contact network, for four more years I tried to continue this legacy. From time
to time I would have editorial help from a few other collaborators, but I did
not know how to nurture those relationships and was all too used to going it
alone. So I would mine the URI and NAIN mailing lists, [Worldwide Faith
News](https://www.wfn.org/), [Religion News Service](https://religionnews.com/),
and other sources for whatever material I could find that was _interfaith /
inter-religious_ and (generally) represented _cooperation and dialogue_, rather
than animosity and division.

By the summer of 2006 my responsibilities in the local Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;
community had increased and my time for interfaith work consequently diminished.
Thus the October, 2006 electronic newsletter was the last. There was one more
article in 2007, and then &helllip; a regrettable mistake: I cancelled the
Internet hosting and lost my backups. Like so many other web sites over the
years, it was lost to the world.

Fast forward: some muse breathed into me a desire to look through the site
again. And I remembered: the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), which
is an attempt to capture the whole of the World Wide Web. Here I could find, in
imperfect form and detail, old copies of the site. As a digital anthropologist,
I have cleaned and restored all that I could. No new life has been breathed into
it; it is merely a memorialization, a museum-ification, of what had once been an
important part of my avocational life.

At last, in time for 2022, the memorial is complete:

The third design looked much like the current memorial design at the top of the page.
