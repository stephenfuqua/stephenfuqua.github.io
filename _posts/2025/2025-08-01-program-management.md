title: "Program Management: Embracing an Overlooked Art"

(Technical) program management is the art of getting to "done done." Not the simplistic done of "this feature is finished," or the half-baked done of "this application works, release it and see what happens." It is the done of "we finished what we started, delivered what was needed, and there are no surprises."

Some sense told me that something was missing from my approach. Perhaps several somethings. Am I managing products well? Delivering on projects within expectations? Scrum had been my _modus operandi_ as a team lead for so long that I had failed to recognize and value the art and science of advanced project management.


, until some unremembered trigger prompted me to ask myself: if we have a ScrumMaster, what is exactly is that program manager does in service to the product and organization? And how does that differ from product management? And as I began reading and asking more questions, it became clear to me that this was a missing - or at least underdeveloped - skill in my portfolio.

## A Brief Memoir in Project Management

Early in my career I encountered the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and spent a week training on classical waterfall based project management. It was interesting, but we were running too fast - and my time too valuable as a programmer - for much time applying the lessons learned.

One day, a very large prospective client asked, in a written response to a proposal: what is your software development methodology? These were new words to me. The project management work did not seem like a clear methodology, so I rushed over to Barnes and Noble and browsed through the offerings. It was then that I learned of "Agile." Not a single methodology, but a collection of related approaches whose commonalities appealed. There was enough vagueness that we could claim to be Agile with the greatest of ease. But I took to heart the idea that we seek feedback early and often, embracing change, reducing artificial gates, and working in cross-functional collaboration.

And I eventually embraced Scrum, taking a lead in Agile transformations and process improvement. The lessons of PMBOK training were relegated to the corners, only occasionally manifesting through intuitive risk-based prioritization. I never held the purse strings (budget), and only stood as proxy for the scope. Quality and timeliness were my primary responsibilities. At least, until all of these and more became my accountabilities.

## Discovering Project Management

... where did I read... ?

... Google's four roles on a spectrum ... was that from the presentation at that Austin event?

... product management: save this for another day.

Interrelated skills of a (technical) program manager:

... driving toward clarity (which may mean leaning in to help the product manager)
... managing risks
... communicating with stakeholders
... getting to Done.

(was that it?)

Things that a skilled ScrumMaster works on. In some sense there may not be a difference. And this highlights that ScrumMaster was meant to be a role that someone plays, not a job title in itself (a bit like "DevOps Engineer" perhaps). The role is to facilitate the Scrum practices. The Scrum practices do not (CHECK THIS!⚠️) \ call for risk management, or for developing a communications plan beyond the sprint review. But for a project to be successful, much more is needed beyond ensuring that stakeholders understand - inspect and adapt - the results of a sprint, or that they and the product owner are in sync on the product goal.
