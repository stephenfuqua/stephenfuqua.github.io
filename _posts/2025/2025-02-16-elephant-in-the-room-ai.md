Data engineering gurus [Joe Reis and Matthew
Housley](https://www.ternarydata.com/about-us) once again led a closing town
hall at Data Day Texas. Rather than opining from the front, they turned
the session over to the wisdom of the crowd. Housley seeded the conversation with a
single question – “what is the elephant in the room?” – and the room was ready
with an answer: AI. In particular: what is AI going to do to my job?

Given a room full of strangers, some participants were remarkably open about
their fears. Perhaps knowing that the audience is composed of fellow data geeks
helped to establish a sense of vulnerability. These fears were being expressed
by the people who, in theory, should be the ones developing expertise in using
AI tooling. But that’s how disruptive the technologies may be: even the data
experts are uncertain and afraid.

Perhaps 20 years from now we'll look back and wonder
what the fuss what all about, just as I wonder what the backstory was on this

Or at least _some_ of them are. Some in the audience already see themselves as
the ones leading the AI wave in their companies, and others feel more confident
due to the (perceived?) productivity boost experienced with their own
applications of the technology. Many embrace the idea that [AI Won’t Replace
Humans — But Humans With AI Will Replace Humans Without
AI](https://hbr.org/2023/08/ai-wont-replace-humans-but-humans-with-ai-will-replace-humans-without-ai).

Reading the room, the fear may have been equally about the jobs of the future as
about the participants’ own jobs. Some noted that many companies have already
stopped hiring junior engineers because the LLM assistants are already as good.
A few weeks after the conference, [Salesforce announced no new hiring of
software engineers in
2025](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-will-hire-no-more-software-engineers-in-2025-says-marc-benioff/)
due to LLM-based productivity boosts. A question on many minds: who will be the
engineers of the future if we do not develop new engineers today?

Sidenote: it will be interesting to see if the hiring freezes are temporary or
lasting pauses. Is this perhaps as much a PR ploy as it is an engineering
management strategy?

Some remarked on the need for humans to provide _knowledge engineering_:
structuring knowledge to provide context and more intelligent capability. Hence
the continuing need for [data
cataloging](../2025-02-03-data-cataloging-at-ddtx2025.md). In discussing
education and training, others commented on the need to focus on semantics –
algorithms and problem solving – over syntax. LLM’s can help you write the
proper code in whatever language, but you as an engineer need to know how to
diagnose a problem and describe a solution. Another observation is that these
tools may help us collectively fix the massive tech debt found in mission
critical, but obsolete, software systems.

One individual suggested embracing product management.
Learn to identify and prioritize features and functionality on your own, weaving
them into your AI-assisted tools and products, and then learn how sell and
support those tools for your colleagues’ benefit. But no one dared offer the
suggestion of turning themselves into salespeople for AI-assisted software!

Both fear and excitement were palpable. Perhaps the only certainty we can rely
on is that our jobs, and even more so those of the newcomers to the field, will
continue to evolve at an accelerating pace. Which makes me all the more appreciative of
the fantastic learning environment that is [Data Day Texas](https://datadaytexas.com/).
