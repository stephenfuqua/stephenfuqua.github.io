Like many, when I first encountered the term "agile software development," I
thought it was an excuse for a cowboy culture: low planning, low documentation,
run as fast as you can and assume that each person's brilliance will  take care
of everything. As it came up in the context of a very large client asking us
about our methodology, I thought I should dig into a little more. <a
href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Integrating_Agile_Development_In_The_Rea.html?id=9J_0ly01QicC">Integrating
Agile Development in the Real World</a>, by Peter Schuh, quickly showed me it is
not that simple. Agile development is, in fact, all about fostering a
systematic, right-sized, just-in-time development process. For me, being "agile"
means embracing change instead of being locked into preconceived notions
(requirements). But don't throw everything out the window either.

How do we become agile? Read the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile
Manifesto</a>, then scroll down and read the Agile Principles. Work on
internalizing them, especially that part where the Manifesto acknowledges value
in processes, tools, documentation, etc.: "while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more." That's a start on the mindset.
Now what about practice?

Review the various methodologies. Consider adopting <a
href="http://www.scrum.org/">Scrum</a> (<a
href="http://www.scrumalliance.org">2</a>),<a
href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Crystal+methodologies"> Crystal Clear</a>, <a
href="www.extremeprogramming.org">Extreme Programming</a>, <a
href="http://www.dsdm.org/content/what-dsdm">DSDM</a>, or <a
href="http://www.adaptivesd.com/">Adaptive Software Development</a>. All of
these are mature frameworks with a great deal of experience behind them. If
possible, adopt one _by the book_: don't try to adapt or alter until you've
mastered the practice (<a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Shu+Ha+Ri">Shu Ha
Ri</a>). If it is "not possible," then adopt what you can and work on breaking
down the barriers, in _close collaboration_ with stakeholders and management
(you won't be able to go it alone, from the trenches).
