I've always been a  fan of keyboard shortcuts, using them whenever possible.
Today I accidentally pressed the Windows key and D at the same time &mdash; and
suddenly found that my whole desktop was revealed. How did I not know about
this? A quick search led me to a <a
href="http://www.windowsnetworking.com/articles_tutorials/Windows-XP-Keyboard-Shortcuts.html">great
page</a> with another 8-10 shortcuts I didn't previously know. Now you too can
be enlightened about the many uses of the Windows key.
