I don't often have cause to use threading. In fact, I've found that it sometimes
gums up the works (perhaps because I don't understand it well enough?) &mdash;
slows things down. But when I do want to do some threading in C#, here are a few
pages I find helpful in reminding myself how to perform various functions:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/threads/">Multi-threading in .NET: Introduction and suggestions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.albahari.com/threading/">Threading in C# - Free E-book</a></li>
<li>MSDN's <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645740(vs.71).aspx">Threading Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
