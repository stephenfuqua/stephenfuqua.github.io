PBS's Robert X. Cringeley thinks Intel is <a
href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050609.html">poised to buy
Apple</a>, saying "Apple's Decision to Use Intel Processors Is Nothing Less Than
an Attempt to Dethrone Microsoft. Really." What is a fan of upstart competitors
to do when his favorite upstart (Apple) might merge with one of the upstarted
(Intel as opposed to AMD)? Course its sheer speculation at this point, but
Cringley makes fascinating observations. Since a friend mentioned two days ago
not wanting to replace his broken Powerbook, as it would be obsolete in a year
or two, I've wondered why Apple would make such a big announcement and risk
major sales losses. Hm...
