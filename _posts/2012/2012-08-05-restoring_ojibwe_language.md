In honor and memory of Mr. Ronald White, of St. Paul, MN, I set out this evening
to find a documentary on the Ojibwe people and/or language. His story, as a part
of that people, is not mine to tell (in so far as I know some miniscule part).
So I will share this documentary. It does not sugar coat the past, but neither
does it dwell on it. It dwells on the present and the future of the native
language and culture of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and other areas around the Great
Lakes.

Two of many items that grabbed my attention and reflection: (1) opening comments
noting how many people are concerned with the loss of habitat, but are not also
concerned or knowledgeable about the loss of cultures. (2) "You don't have to
say 'respect your elders' in Ojibwe - its built right in" -- "elderly man" is
"great being," and "elderly woman" is "she who holds together". Words for the
sun and grandfather are the same, as are grandmother and the moon. You could ask
"is the moon up?" and mean "is grandmother stirring?"
