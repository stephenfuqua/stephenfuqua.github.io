Recently I ran across and old article from Phil Haack, about moving his
blog to [Jekyll using GitHub](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/).
And I realized that this is (or might be?) a perfect solution for managing
content *about* the FlightNode project (though it will not be part of the
platform itself).

There is a lot of work to do in terms of getting content up and getting
it formatted. This is just the start of getting the framework going, so 
that I can get all the text and pictures out of my head and into 
documentation that other team members can use.

  Doesn't actually work for me, I get a gcc build error. Will probably
  switch to starting up a Vagrant box with Ubuntu.
