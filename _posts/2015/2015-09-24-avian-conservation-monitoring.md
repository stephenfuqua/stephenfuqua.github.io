The general problem, succinctly stated: 

> As human-dominated land uses replace native landscapes across 
> North America, there is growing concern about the impacts this 
> habitat loss will have on native bird populations. With many 
> migratory bird species in decline, it is essential to assess 
> the effectiveness of our conservation initiatives \[[1](#1)\].

Of course, this applies around the world, not just in North America.
There are hundreds of organizations and researchers working to 
understand the characteristics of current bird populations, and our 
impact on sustaining and growing those populations. The need for this
work grows ever more pressing for those who recognize the value
of maintaining diverse and vibrant ecosystems, especially in light
of climate change \[[2](#2)\]. 

Many people use a popular, and frankly excellent, application called 
[eBird](http://www.ebird.org) for collecting bird population data
from citizen-scientists. However, that application is is geared toward
a very general sort of data collection, which is well-suited for
your work-a-day birder who wants to record what s/he has seen. But
it is *not* well-suited for more rigorous scientific protocols.

Organizations and researchers cannot rely on eBird alone for many 
of their data collection and reporting needs. Their projects often
need to track volunteers and detailed geographic locations, often
at multiple scales, e.g. region (North Texas), site (Pioneer Park), 
point (lat/long). They want to communicate with those volunteers 
easily, keeping them informed of news and events. They may even
want to facilitate some online training.

Rather than merely tailor a piece of software for a specific project,
the FlightNode project aims to build a platform that can be tailored
for many different types of projects, thus lowering the overall
cost and burden of implementing an online management tool.
