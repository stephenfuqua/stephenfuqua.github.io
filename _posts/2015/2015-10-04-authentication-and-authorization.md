Here is a a brief demonstration of authentication and authorization using the 
FlightNode.Identity API. Significant help developing this received from
[ASP.NET Identity 2.1 with ASP.NET Web API 2.2 (Accounts Management) ](http://bitoftech.net/2015/01/21/asp-net-identity-2-with-asp-net-web-api-2-accounts-management/)
by Taiseer Joudeh.

Requires cloning the [FlightNode.Identity](https://github.com/FlightNode/FlightNode.Identity)
and [FlightNode.Common](https://github.com/FlightNode.Common) repositories.

## Initial Database Setup

When running on your localhost for the first time, open the NuGet Package 
Manager Console. Switch to the FlightNode.Identity project. Then execute 
command `Update-Database â€“Verbose` to install the identity model tables into 
the `(localdb)\ProjectsV12` database (that is default server name is in the 
config file). This uses Entity Framework 
[Code First Migrations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj591621.aspx) 
to install the database. 

The initial database install creates a user with username `ab@asfddfsdfs.com` 
and password `dirigible1`. Clearly it is not good that the whole world knows 
this now, so the first thing to do is change that password. Which is a great 
way to test that the install worked properly.

## Authenticate
	
To authenticate, POST a form-encoded body to the `/oauth/token` endpoint. 
Screenshots below are using Postman. The response will include an OAuth2 
bearer token. In a real application, we would read this token and store* 
it for use with other API requests. * The best storage mechanism is 
LocalStorage.
	
Copy the value of the `access_token` from the response so that you can use 
it in subsequent steps.

## 	Modify the User
	
Now we'll issue a POST request to the User route, using a JSON-formatted body. 
Assuming a fresh database install, the user ID will be 1.  With this request, 
we'll not only change the password, but we'll also configure a new username, 
e-mail address and phone number. Leaving the mobile phone number null is just 
for show and it is not necessary to specify that.
	
    POST http://localhost:50323/api/v1/user/1
	
    Headers:
    Content-Type = application/json
	
    Body:
    {
      "userId": 1,
      "userName": "dirigible@asfddfsdfs.com",
      "email": "dirigible@asfddfsdfs.com",
      "phoneNumber": "555-555-5555",
      "mobilePhoneNumber": null,
      "password": "dirigible"
     }

## Create Authorization Header

Unauthorized!?!?!?
	
Well of course, that's what we wanted: the request did not have a bearer token 
in it - that is, the user is not authorized. And thus we received status code 
`401`, as appropriate. If you look in the UserController code, you'll see
that it is decorated with the `[Authorize]` attribute, which is how you tell
ASP.NET to check for a valid OAuth2-style bearer token before allowing the
method to be executed.

So what do we need? We need another Header:

    Authorization = bearer <the token response from earlier>

And now&hellip;

Everything is OK! 

Oh, and while working on this code, I actually removed the password save. 
That should probably only occur with a special request to change the password.
