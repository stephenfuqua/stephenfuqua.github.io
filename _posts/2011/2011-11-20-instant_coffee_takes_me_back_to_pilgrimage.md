We ran out of regular coffee, hence drinking instant this morning (Pampa brand
from Mexico). The smell of this brand takes me back to Haifa, where I went on <a

Pilgrimage a year ago</a>. The B&amp;B we stayed in had an electric kettle and
kept us well-stocked with packages of instant coffee. On mornings where we had
to get moving before the cafe downstairs opened, that was my wake-up.

One year later&hellip; and how has that trip affected my life? There, I
encountered a beauty and serenity unlike anything I've ever seen or felt before.
On many occasions since, I have let that sense be an anchor, bringing calm to my
mind and helping me withstand tests and challenges.

The Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Holy Places are of historic significance to the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s, linking us to the pivotal moments that shaped the
unfolding of the religion we profess. Their upkeep is not a matter of tourism
(in fact, no contributions, fees, or payments to the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; World
Center are asked of the pilgrim). It is on the one hand the ultimate sign of
respect for the founders of our Faith, and on the other it is a form of prayer
and worship to the Divine. It is also a symbol of the harmony and
order-from-chaos that the religion is intended to establish amongst humanity.

There is no getting around it; Israel is a conflict-laden land. It is also a
bustling, thriving, highly urbanized nation. To experience Pilgrimage is to get
a glimpse into the local political and religious challenges faced by the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s as they emerged from imprisonment and onto the world stage
(though the Central Figures disdained politics, it constantly tried to follow
Them). Gaining a greater understanding and appreciation of this context was
another take-way. And, it offered a glimpse into how we can, even in an
over-crowded world, both restore and create anew a sense of place that nourishes
our body, mind, and soul.

I believe that the reverence, awe, serenity, and wonder of Pilgrimage will hold
throughout my life, and though the motivating spirit be unknown, in the small
works that one day I will have left behind.
