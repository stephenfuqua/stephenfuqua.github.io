When I became a Bah&aacute;'&iacute; in the 90s, perhaps the second deliberate
change I made (prayer being the first) was to act with greater respect and
appreciation towards my parents. I have long remembered that there was a
particular passage that prompted this change; the "Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith"
quote service on Facebook has brought that long-sought quotation back to me
today:

> "The fruits that best befit the tree of human life are trustworthiness and
> godliness, truthfulness and sincerity; but greater than all, after recognition
> of the unity of God, praised and glorified be He, is regard for the rights
> that are due to one's parents. This teaching hath been mentioned in all the
> Books of God, and reaffirmed by the Most Exalted Pen. Consider that which the
> Merciful Lord hath revealed in the Qur'&aacute;n, exalted are His words:
> "Worship ye God, join with Him no peer or likeness; and show forth kindliness
> and charity towards your parents&hellip;" Observe how loving-kindness to
> one&#8217;s parents hath been linked to recognition of the one true God!"
>
> ~ Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, The Kit&aacute;b-i-Aqdas, <a
> href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-15.html.utf8?query=loving-kindness|parents&action=highlight#gr209">paragraph
> 106</a>.

How did this change manifest itself? The only particular act I can remember is
that I began frequently doing the dishes when at home :-).
