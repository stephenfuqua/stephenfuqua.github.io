_Overclocked, Stories of the Future Present_, is worth buying. But you don't
have to, thanks to the fact that Doctorow made it available under a Creative
Commons license, and you can <a

These are incredible short stories, standing up with the best of Bradbury and
Gaiman (my favorite short story authors). _When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth_ was
gut-wrenching, at least for this former sysadmin. _I, Row Boat_ manages to
beguile and frighten you at the same time. What's more frightening than an
angry, conscious, coral reef? Pared up with a row boat working through
existentialism? _Print Crime_ is a beautiful call to the indomitability of the
human spirit, and _Anda's Game_ is all kinds of biting and insightful commentary
wrapped up in the thrill of virtual victory. _I, Robot_ and _After the Seige_
round out the brilliant set of stories.
