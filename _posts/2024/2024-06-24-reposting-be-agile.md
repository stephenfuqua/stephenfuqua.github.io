"Agile" is not a [silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)
for improving software productivity, reliability, and simplicity. But "Agile"
continues to give us tools that _can_ foster improved software engineering.

The Agile Manifesto was a distillation of certain trends that the authors had
noticed in their successful projects. On balance, they ring true to my
twenty-five year career in software.

In reflection on all of the "agile is dead" articles, I have cleaned up my [2013
notes on Agile](/archive/2013/07/13/tackle_be_agile/). Perhaps some newcomer to
the field will find it useful.
