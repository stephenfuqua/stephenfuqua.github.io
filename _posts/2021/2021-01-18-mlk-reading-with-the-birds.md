It looks like a beautiful morning in Austin, Texas, from the comfort of my
feeder-facing position on the couch. Later in the afternoon I will get out and
enjoy it on my afternoon walk with [All Things
Considered](https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/). As I write
these lines a bully has been at work: a Yellow-Rumped Warbler (Myrtle) has been
chasing the other birds away. Thankfully this greedy marauder was absent for
most of the morning, as I read portions of [Dr. J. Drew
Lanham](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/faculty_staff/profiles/lanhamj)'s _[The
Home Place, Memoirs of a Colored Man's Love Affair with
Nature](https://milkweed.org/book/the-home-place)_.

Lanham, who also penned the harrowing-yet-humorous [9 Rules for the Black
Birdwatcher](https://orionmagazine.org/article/9-rules-for-the-black-birdwatcher/),
shares a compelling and beautifully-written story of family and place &mdash; at
least, those are the key themes of first third of the book that I've read thus
far. Appropriate to this day of reflection and remembrance for one of our great
American heroes, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, it is a story of forces and people
who shaped this scientist, a Black man from the South who learned to love nature
from the first-hand experiences of playing, watching, listening, chopping, and
hoeing on the edge of the South Carolina piedmont.

Understanding that one man's experience, views, and insights can never
encapsulate those of an entire amorphous people, it is nevertheless critical
that we all spend time getting to better know and understand the forces that
shape our myriad cultures and the people who emerge from them. As we become more
familiar with "others," "they" become "we" and "we" become self-aware. Becoming
self-aware, we recognize the truth of Dr. King's famous saying:

> "We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single
> garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."

Being aware of our mutuality, believing in it deeply, we can make better choices
about how to live well with and for everyone on this planet, both those alive
today and those yet to be born.

A passage of beautiful prose from pages 1-2 of _The Home Place_, to give you a
taste of what is in store. After describing his ethno-racial heritage &mdash;
primarily African American with an admixture of European , American Indian,
Asian, "and Neanderthal tossed in" &mdash; he remarks,

> "But that's only a part of the whole: There is also the red of miry clay,
> plowed up and planted to pass a legacy forward. There is the brown of spring
> floods rushing over a Savannah River shoal. There is the gold of ripening
> tobacco drying in the heat of summer's last breath. There are endless rows of
> cotton's cloudy white. My plumage is a kaledeiscopic rainbow of an eternal
> hope and the deepest blue of despair and darkness. All of these hues are me; I
> am, in the deepest sense, colored."
