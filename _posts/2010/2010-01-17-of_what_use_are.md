They are the aliment of imagination,<br>
The wellspring of delight.<br>
They turn stars into heroes,<br>
Bring peace to the night.

Fear they can banish,<br>
And in good measure bestow.<br>
All good stories teach;<br>
Even heroes they bring low.

Words are more than letters,<br>
As letters are more than lines.<br>
In the mirror of darkest tales, <br>
Verily even sorrow shines.

When polished in contemplation,<br>
The reflection you will find,<br>
Far eclipses all that<br>
The narrator had in mind.
