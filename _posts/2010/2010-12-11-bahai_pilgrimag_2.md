Perhaps my most powerful emotion in direct reaction to the sites we visited
during the pilgrimage was a feeling of peace and contentment. From 1853 to His
death in 1892, Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h lived a life of exile and periodic
imprisonmnet. The lowest point was His imprisonment in the <a
href="http://www.bahaullah.org/akka/imposing-citadel">citadel of
'Akk&aacute;</a> in Syria &mdash; in the heart of a prison city built above the
fetid ruins of the Cruisader capital of St. Jean de Acre.

The Citadel of 'Akk&aacute;

<!--more-->

After two years and two months in the citadel, the army needed to use it as a
barracks and forced Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, his family and followers (around
70 people), to vacate, providing a small pension for renting homes. The family
(fourteen, I believe) found a small house, with three rooms as I recall.
Extremely crowded and very poor conditions, but an improvement over the citadel.
After a few years, the owner of the <a
href="http://www.bahaullah.org/akka/hatred-to-admiration">adjoining house</a>
made it available for rent, allowing the family (which had by that time grown
due to 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;'s marriage) to spread out into another four or five
rooms, one of which has a magnificent balcony looking out over the
Mediterranean.

{: .center-block} While He was never released by the Ottoman Sultan, sympathetic
governors and muftis eventually convinced Him to move out of the city, to a <a
href="http://www.bahaullah.org/mazraih/mansion-mazraih">small house in the
village of Mazra'ih</a>. This was about seven years after leaving the citadel.
The house seen in the linked photo is larger than it was at the time. A British
soldier and his wife (a Bah&aacute;'&iacute;) had lived there for some years,
closing in the courtyard and adding two large rooms to the front. In this house
He lived for two years.

The back garden at Mazra'ih; the pool was fed by an aqueduct running through the grounds, from near modern Lebanon to the city of 'Akk&aacute;.

Finally, in 1879 a <a
href="http://www.bahaullah.org/bahji/recognition-grows">large house</a> became
available, again outside the city, because the inhabitants had fled due to some
pestilence. The beautfiul mansion, and a series of smaller houses next to it,
set amidst the garden retreat of a former provincial governor, finally gave the
extended family room to breath. Though nominally a prisoner, and certainly
unable to leave the region, Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h at last had some measure
of freedom and beauty returned to His life. By this time his worldly ministry
was longer over &mdash; turned over to His Son 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;' &mdash; but
He continued revealing "the word of God" through tablets and epistles. Still
beset by many enemies, each of these moves would have brought some comfort to
His life. That is the sense of peace that I felt &mdash; the sense of a small
measure of just deserts and karma in these successive abodes.
