The words "thou" and "thee" are unfamiliar to most of us, except in the context
of sacred writ (particularly the _King James Bible_). Thus many of us think of
"thou" as very formal. In some Dostoyevsky novel, I encountered something to the
effect of "why did you address me with the familiar thou?". That got me
thinking: is "thou" is an outdated form of familar address, like "t&uacute;"
compared to "su" in Spanish? Well, more or less, though that distinction may not
do it justice in the context of sacred literature.

<a href="http://etymonline.com/columns/do-be-thee.htm">Etymology
Online</a> has a nice little article about the downfall of "thou"
and "thee." In a nutshell, "ye" and "you" are the pluralization of
"thou" and "thee", and people started using them for singular as a
sign of respect (in other words, "y'all" would historically have
been redudant since "you" was already encompassing of "all"). That
respect was eventually brought to everyone, even inferiors, and the
singular versions were lost. For some reason the subject version
"ye" was merged into the object version "you" so that we do not say
"ye are boring me" but rather "you are boring me." So it seems like
the use of "thou" and "thee" in the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; writings
might give the connotation of some familiarity and personal
relationship with God.

It can be difficult to work through these words, so why use
them? Today I stumbled across a few Biblical articles that made me
revisit that idea of familiarity, perhaps giving a better answer.
In a nutshell, the idea is that the difference between singular and
plural is actually important &mdash; so the antiquated words are
used not because of familiarity but rather for accuracy. It
signifies the particular compared to the general. Person A
addresses a crowd with "ye" and "you" and a particular person in
the crowd with "thee" and "thou". In order to test this hypothesis,
I did a little search for something in the writings that contains
both forms. Turns out there are many instances! The translators,
whose "gold standard" is the work of Shoghi Effendi, had
purposefully chosen to use the two forms. Here is a sample, one of
many, with the different forms highlighted (also highlighted is
"thy", the possessive of "thou", thus equivalent to plural
"your")

> "O King of Paris! Tell the priests to ring the bells no longer. By God, the
> True One! The Most Mighty Bell hath appeared in the form of Him Who is the
> Most Great Name, and the fingers of the Will of <span style="background-color:
> yellow">Thy</span> Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, toll it out in the

>
> Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, _Summons of the Lord of Hosts_,
> [p67](http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/SLH/slh-6.html).

So let's compare the two perspectives. Thinking strictly of
familiarity, I don't understand why there is a sudden switch from
thee to ye and thou to you in the middle of this passage. But
thinking in terms of singular vs. plural, it suddenly makes a great
deal of sense. At the beginning of the passage, Napoleon III is
being addressed, in particular. Not in general, but directly
addressing Napoleon. Therefore "thy", "thee", and "thou" show up.
But in the second half, after the command "say," we have a shift to
the plural. This shift then signifies that
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h is no longer directly addressing
Napoleon, but addressing everyone.

Is this an accurate reading? I have no evidence to suggest this
interpretation is correct. However, it does seem to shed a new and
important light on the passage. If any readers know of anything to
support or condemn this understanding, please share it with the
rest of us.
