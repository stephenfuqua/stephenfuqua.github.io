In an <a
href="http://bahai-library.com/provisionals/lawh.bagh.ridvan.html">epistle</a>
extolling the Ridv&aacute;n Gardens outside of 'Akk&aacute; &mdash; more on
which in a future post &mdash; Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h wrote that "God's power
and the perfection of His handiwork could enjoyably be seen in the blossoms, the
fruits, the trees, the leaves and the streams." In that spirit, the time spent
out in the various "<a
href="http://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/">Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Gardens</a>" was an
integral part of the spiritual experience of the pilgrimage &mdash; linking
physical sensation with spiritual "praise" of creation &dagger;. No matter how
handsome the building, I will always feel most alive and aware in natural (or
semi-natural) settings.

It strikes me that Western development since the time of the Romans has
primarily seen "sacred space" as enclosed by walls and a ceiling. But for many
cultures, historical and modern, the sacred is found in the open. For me, these
gardens &mdash; and those at other Bah&aacute;'&iacute; sites in Israel &mdash;
have managed to embrace the unbounded-quality of the word "space". Further, they
have done so in a manner that increasingly attempts to balance out our notions
of the manicured and tamed nature with more naturalistic landscape
architectures.

Most pictures of the Terraces on Mt. Carmel show the highly-groomed (and
beautiful) central section. But these photos show the natural landscapes that
have been developed on their flanks. These areas are attracting wildlife back to
this northern side of Mt. Carmel, including many species of birds, locally rare
bats, reptiles, and we have it on good authority that there are hedgehogs,
jackals (I found two game trails that were probably made by the jackals), and
even a wild boar recently. Naturally we had difficulty ID'ing the birds, but
positive ID on Hooded Crow, White-Spectacled Bulbul, Palestinian Sunbird,
European Robin, Eurasian Blackbird, Laughing Dove, Grey Wagtail, Blackcap,
Eurasian Collared Dove, Sombre Tit, Ring-necked Parakeet in the Terraces and
related grounds, and suspected Yellow-Browed Warbler and Tawny Pipit and a few
other unknowns. And of course the ubiquitous Rock Pigeon.

From an observation platform to the west of the terrace 18 you can get a sense of the gradient from manicured grasses to native vegetation.
