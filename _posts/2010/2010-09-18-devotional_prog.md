This devotional program was presented at the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; House of
Worship on September 5, 2010. Before going upstairs into the temple, I joked to
my friend that I wanted to go downstairs to the bookstore, to be material before
being spiritual. The architecture is inspiring enough, but the devotions and
music were, well, heavenly :-).

> Lord! Pitiful are we, grant us thy favor; poor, bestow upon us a share from the ocean of Thy wealth; needy, do Thou satisfy us; abased, 
> give us Thy glory. the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field receive 
> their meat each day from Thee, and all beings partake of Thy care and 
> loving-kindness.
> 
> Deprive not this feeble one of Thy wondrous grace and 
> vouchsafe by Thy might unto this helpless soul Thy bounty.
> 
> Give us our daily 
> bread, and grant Thin increase in the necessities of life, that we may be 
> dependent on none other but Thee, may commune wholly with Thee, may walk in Thy 
> ways and declare Thy mysteries. Thou art the Almighty and the Loving and the 
> Provider of all mankind.

## Meditations for days of plenty

> Should a man wish to adorn himself with the ornaments of the earth, to wear
> its apparels, or partake of the benefits it can bestow, no harm can befall
> him, if he alloweth nothing whatever to intervene between him and God, for God
> hath ordained every good thing, whether created in the heavens or in the
> earth, for such of His servants as truly believe in Him. Eat ye, O people, of
> the good things which God hath allowed you, and deprive not yourselves from
> His wondrous bounties. Render thanks and praise unto Him, and be of them that
> are truly thankful.
>
> _Gleanings from the Writings of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h_, p 276

> ... It is good and comely for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of
> all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
> God giveth him: for it is his portion. Every man also to whom God hath given
> riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his
> portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.
>
> _The Torah_, Kesuvim, Koheles (Ecclesiastes) 5:18-19

> Blessed is the rich man whom earthly possessions have been powerless to hinder
> turning unto God, the Lord of all names. Verily he is accounted among the most
> distinguished of men before God, the Gracious, the All-knowing.
>
> Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h: _Compilation on Huq&uacute;qu'll&aacute;h_, p. 4

## Inspirations for times of financial struggle

> Say: I swear by God! No one is despised in the sight of the Almighty for being
> poor. Rather is he exalted, if he is fond to be of them who are patient.
> Blessed are the poor that are steadfast in patience...
>
> Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h: _Compilation on Huq&uacute;qu'll&aacute;h_, p. 4

> And he lifted us his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for
> yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be
> filled... Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward
> is great in heaven...
>
> _The Bible_, Luke 2-23

> Great is the blessedness awaiting the poor that endure patiently and conceal
> their sufferings, and well is it with the rich who bestow their riches on the
> needy and prefer them before themselves.
>
> _Gleanings from the Writings of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h_, p 202

> Please God, the poor may exert themselves and strive to earn the means of
> livelihood. This is a duty which, in this most great Revelation, hath been
> prescribed unto every one, and is accounted in the sight of God as a goodly
> deed. Whoso observeth this duty, the help of the invisible One shall most
> certainly aid him. He can enrich, through his grace, whomsoever He pleaseth.
>
> _Gleanings from the Writings of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h_, p 202

## Verses for all times

> ... man should know his own self and recognize that which leadeth unto
> loftiness or lowliness, glory or abasement, wealth or poverty. Having attained
> the stage of fulfilment and reached his maturity, man standeth in need of
> wealth, and such wealth as he acquireth through crafts or professions is
> commendable and praiseworthy in the estimation of men of wisdom, and
> especially in the eyes of servants who dedicate themselves to the education of
> the world and to the edification of its peoples.
>
> _Tablets of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h_, p 35

> All that which ye potentially possess can, however, be manifested only as a
> result of your own volition.
> 
> _Gleanings from the Writings of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h_, p 149

> O SON OF MAN!
> 
> Should prosperity befall thee, rejoice not, and should abasement come upon
> thee, grieve not, for both shall pass away and be no more.
>
> Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h: _The Arabic Hidden Words_, #52

> Health is the supreme possession. Contentment is the supreme wealth. A
> trustworthy friend is the supreme relation.
>
> _Dhammapada - Sayings of the Buddha I_, s. 14

> It is God who created you and then provided for you; and then will make you
> die, and then will quicken you again; is there any of your partners who can do
> aught of that? Celebrated be His praises, and exalted be He above what they
> associate with Him!
>
> _The Qur'an_, 30:1

> We have enjoined upon all to become engaged in some trade or profession, and
> have accounted such occupation to be an act of worship. Before all else,
> however, thou shouldst receive, as a sign of God's acceptance, the mantle of
> trustworthiness from the hands of divine favour; for trustworthiness is the
> chief means of attracting confirmation and prosperity. We entreat God to make
> of it a radiant and mercifully showering rain-cloud that shall bring success
> and blessings to thy affairs. He of a truth is the All-bountiful, the
> Gracious.
>
> Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h: _The Compilation of Compilations vol II_, p 335

> O my God! I ask Thee, by Thy most glorious Name, to aid me in that which will

> place my whole trust in  Thee.
>
> Grant me then Thy sufficing help so as to make me independent of all things, O
> Thou Who art unsurpassed in Thy mercy!
>
> Bestow upon me my portion, O Lord, as thou pleasest, and cause me to be
> satisfied with whatsoever Thou hast ordained for me.
