Spurred on by the goal of giving a brown bag tech talk on the subjects of test-driven development and SOLID object oriented design principles, I've finally collected all of the "wisdom" I've learned over the years into one place: [Best Practices in Test-Driven, Object Oriented, Green- and Brownfield Development](/best-practices-tdd-oo/intro). I plan to keep this as a living document, adding or modifying as I continue to deepen my knowledge through feedback, study, and further experiments.
