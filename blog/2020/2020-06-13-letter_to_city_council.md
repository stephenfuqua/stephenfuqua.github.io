Letter to the City Council of Austin, Texas, in appreciation for [action taken
this
week](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/06/11/austin-police-reform-budget-cut-george-floyd-protests/)
in response to both the killings of George Floyd and others at the hands of
police, and the heavy-handed tactics employed against peaceful protestors.

> Dear City Council Members,
>
> Thank you for passage this week of measures to limit police use of force and
> begin re-prioritizing the city budget. I strongly support these actions as
> meaningful steps toward a future where the intrinsic oneness of humanity is
> fully reflected in our words, our ordinances, and all of our actions.
>
> Systemic inequities require systemic, systematic, and continuous attention
> through careful study of patterns, consultation on remedies, thoughtful
> action, and humble evaluation. Without doubt, these steps move us forward on a
> path. Naturally, questions arise about what next steps may be taken. Further
> demilitarization of policing, adoption of national standards for use of force,
> and appropriate funding for social services that reduce the risk of police
> encounters and escalation should be in the conversation. And, lest one crisis
> drive us to forget another, continued review of police handling of domestic
> abuse and rape cases must remain a priority.
>
> Sincerely,
> Stephen A. Fuqua
