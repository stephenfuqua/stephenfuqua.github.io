On Friday, the flood waters were fully receded on the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River. With only a trace of rain on Saturday, I noticed on Sunday afternoon that
the Elm Fork had returned to a flood warning. The Army Corps must have released
water from one of the upstream lakes again. Quickly airing-up my tires, I raced
down to Sam Houston Park in the hope of crossing the recently revealed causeway
and seeing whom I could find on the levee-side of the lake. Alas, I was already
too late. But the hour spent at the tantalizingly-small open (to bikers & peds)
part of Sam Houston was well worth it the ride.

This year, the Least Tern pair has been a regular on the Valley Ranch side of
the levee. Apparently they have been spending time on the river-side of the
levee as well. Least Tern and speck of a Barn Swallow:

The wildflowers out here are never fantastic, but they are here. And mostly over
the hill at this point. This is one of the remaining clasping-leaf coneflowers
(in yellow; big green thing unknown). Shockingly there were still a few Texas
bluebonnets blooming in another patch (got lazy with the camera).

As I left the causeway-area and began to make my way around the meadow, I
wondered where all of the flycatchers had gone. Then I spied this Western
Kingbird, unconcerned by the petroleum pipeline below him. For some reason there
were no Scissortail Flycatchers on this side, though plenty on the neighborhood
side of the levee. Eventually I found two Eastern Phoebes and a second Western Kingbird as
well.

While photographing the Kingbird, a short bit of birdsong familiar yet
unplaceable floated toward me. Then this cluster of Gallardia, one of my
favorite wildflowers, caught my eye a short distance down the path. Can you find
the dragonfly in there?

Approaching the flowers, two songbirds suddenly popped into my field of vision.
Though but a brief glance, it was easily sufficient to identify male and female
Painted Buntings, the first I have seen in several years. Eventually I found
three more, and managed to capture a few distant but very recognizable photos:
