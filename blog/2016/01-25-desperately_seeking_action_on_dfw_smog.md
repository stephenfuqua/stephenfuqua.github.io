Back in the '90s, I remember my parents saying that it was less expensive to
inspect their cars in Plano, in Collin County, than a few miles further south in
Dallas County - because of the additional emissions inspections required in the
latter. I never would have imagined that 20 years later, [ten DFW
counties](https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/sip/dfw/dfw-status) are now in non-attainment for smog-producing ozone pollution - _and
we still have no plan to solve the problem_.

Just looking at the smog, we all know it can't be good for any of us. The
American Lung Association has a good article on the [health
effects of ozone pollution.](http://www.stateoftheair.org/2015/health-risks/health-risks-ozone.html) Moreover, [studies
have shown](http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/news/2012/unequal-exposures) that air pollution in general has a disproportionate impact on
Latino and African-American communities.

Last week, I attended my first public hearing of any kind: an opportunity for
the general public to speak to representatives of the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) about their [current
plan](https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/sip/dfw/dfw-latest-ozone) for bringing DFW's ozone levels down to the levels set by the EPA under
the Clean Air Act. In short, they don't have a plan for meeting the current
goal. In October, news came out about [new
EPA standards](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20151001-epa-tightening-limits-on-smog-causing-ozone-linked-to-asthma-respiratory-illness.ece) that will tighten the restrictions even further. The existing
TCEQ plan calls for no new action, suggesting that efficiency gains from
vehicles are sufficient to bring ozone down "close enough" to the EPA mandated
level.

There were between 50 and 70 people in the room, many of whom signed up to
speak. Every single speaker whom I heard in over two hours of testimony spoke
out for a better plan, many of them specifically appealing to the EPA (who had
several representatives in attendance) to take over the planning process. In
over 20 years, TCEQ has not managed to put together a meaningful plan, and the
EPA has the right to impose sanctions and dictate a plan.

After so many years, the testimony was impassioned, and diverse. Parents and
grandparents spoke about their kids', and their own, struggles with asthma.
Particularly moving were the stories of children whose asthma attacks often keep
them out of school or leave them too tired to function well when they do attend.
Older community members talked about the literal daily struggle to breathe. The
injustice of a high concentration of cement processing plants on [West Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Dallas), an area which
is 80% Latino and/or African American, was strongly called out.

Some activists, fed up with years of inaction, were quite strong - even vulgar -
in their language. Personally, I was not pleased to hear that tactic. I can't
see what good it will do. But who am I to judge, when I haven't been on the
front line of the clean air fight for decades?
