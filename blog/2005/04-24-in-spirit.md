A lonely flame chases away \
The velvet embrace of dark \
Claws extending toward my spirit.

Spirit not only lives but \
Dies as the fire extinguished \
By imbalance of nourishment.

The dancing gaiety ebbs every \
So often blow the bellows, \
Resuscitate soul, psyche, spirit.

Though she burns she is not sun, \
Rather radiant rays of moonlight \
Captured under forests' eaves.

The forest is the father of my \
Fears and bearer of my hopes, \
Nursemaid of my dreams.

O live on forest! \
Live on my hopes, my dreams! \
Even the whispering fears too, \
For ye are all but oneâ€” \
In spirit.
