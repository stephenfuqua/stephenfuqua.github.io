Response to the common questions of "where was God?" and "how could God allows
this?" in reference to the devastation of December 26th's earthquake and
tsunamis.

:::

When a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off Indonesia sent gigantic waves crashing
down on hundreds of thousands of hapless souls, countless people around the
world asked: where is God? Touching on an ancient question that has plagued
monotheistic believers through the ages, people wanted to know how their God
could allow such horror to afflict innumerable innocent individuals in some
of the poorest areas of the world. Nearly 170,000 are known to have died.
Thousands of villages, fishing boats, places of worship, farms &ndash;
decimated. Colin Powell remarked that it was worse than a war zone.
We&rsquo;ve seen the images and heard the tales of woe &ndash; and where was
God?

I cannot speak for anyone else&rsquo;s conception of God &ndash; but on
January 8th I knew my answer. God was at the Jami Masjid in Las Vegas, where
I attended a fundraiser at which the Islamic Society of Nevada announced it
had raised over $70,000 for charities on the ground in South Asia (by the
way, the crowd consisted of a few hundred Muslims as well as a couple of
Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and one Baha&rsquo;i). The universal spirit of
consciousness that I sometimes call &ldquo;God&rdquo; was with the Vancouver
Buddhists that decided to sell their temple in order to send half a million
dollars (Canadian) to the unfortunate recipients of Mother Nature&rsquo;s
blind movements.

God was most certainly with the dozens of major Christian groups who
broadened their often praiseworthy humanitarian work &ndash; and raised
millions of dollars &ndash; to include all of the affected lands. The Holy
Spirit, the Buddha-nature, Allah, Brahman &ndash; something deeper than the
everyday physical reality of mankind &ndash; was at work when one nation
after another pledged billions of dollars for the short and long term relief
efforts. The list of groups religious, a-religious, and probably even
irreligious who have contributed to the humanitarian relief is too long to
even begin mentioning names.

Often my rational mind questions what I mean when I say, &ldquo;I believe in
God.&rdquo; Sometimes I am even convinced that I do not &ndash; but oddly enough
this horrendous disaster has helped stem that tide of internal questioning. I
may not understand what God is; what I do intellectualize is far different from
what I once envisioned. But I do know Something is there, beyond my grasp, but
leading mankind to compassion and noble deeds. A rabbi at _Jewsweek_ (dead link

the wake of this tragedy be not &lsquo;Why did it happen?&rsquo; but rather
&lsquo;What can I do to help?&rsquo;&rdquo;

The [Pluralism
Project](https://pluralism.org/search/site/south%20asia%20earthquakes?&solrsort=%20)
has an excellent collection of articles relating to religious responses to the
tsunamis. A search of Google News reveals the positive responses as well as the
questioning that inspired this editorial.

Google is also hosting one of dozens of lists of charitable relief organizations
(dead link removed; SF 2025) to which you can add your donations. One not on
their list was my personal charity of choice, the [Association for India&rsquo;s
Development](https://www.aidindia.org).
