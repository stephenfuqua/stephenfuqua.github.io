Inspired by the WorldChanging article "Bird Flu: Can We Out-Collaborate a Pandemic?" (dead link removed; SF 2025), I want to join the blogosphere chorus for educating the public about the dangers of avian influenza. This is a nasty topic almost no one knows about. Instead of writing my own article, I've borrowed the following from one Barry Campbell and his blog [Enrevanche](https://enrevanche.blogspot.com/2005/08/bird-flu-can-we-out-collaborate.html), licensed under the [Creative Commons SA 2.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/).

> 1. Bird flu ("avian influenza H5N1") which has been **making domestic and wild birds sick in Asia for years**, is spreading rapidly, reaching epidemic levels in Russia and extending its reach towards Europe. (Source: Times of London (dead link removed; SF 2025)) If you are a bird, this sucks.
>
> 2. In its current form, bird flu can also make people and other animals sick (more than 50 people have died from it already in Asia since 2003) but it is **relatively hard to transmit**. (Source: USA Today (dead link removed; SF 2025), quoting [WHO](https://www.who.int/en/) statistics.)
>    * The great fear is that the virus might mutate in such a way that it could jump between birds and human beings, and **pass from human to human, much more easily.**
>    * This is an **especially nasty flu virus**, in that it has killed (so far) **over 50%** of the people who are known to have gotten sick with it.
>    * If you are a bird, or a person, or any of the animals that can get the flu, this sucks.
>
> 3. **Public health agencies**, within individual governments and across governmental boundaries, **have been trying, and mostly failing, to alert the public** to the potential risk of a bird flu pandemic in the human population.
>
> 4. An **uncontained epidemic of bird flu could kill millions** (of people; it has already killed millions of birds.)
>
> 5. We may not have time to prepare and distribute updated human vaccine stocks, and almost certainly don't have the resources to inoculate the whole world; however, we can **stockpile modern anti-viral drugs**, which are highly effective against flu if they are taken within a few days of the onset of symptoms, so that they could **quickly be rushed to "hot spots" in the event of a major outbreak**.
>
> 6. Should the virus mutate into more easily transmissable form, and should public health monitoring pick up the clusters of new infection in time, **aggressive treatment** (with antivirals, see point 5) plus **travel restrictions** and quarantines are our **best hope to avoid a tragedy**.
>
> 7. It is now time to **rally public support** behind plans for such aggressive monitoring and plan for intervention.

> Got a blog, or a mailing list? Use your influence: talk the issue up. Alex Steffen's excellent article at WorldChanging (dead link removed; SF 2025) (which moved me to write this post) has good suggestions for how to do it and points to excellent resources for you to use.
