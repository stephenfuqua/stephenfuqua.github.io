Change happens. Today is not the same as yesterday, and both are far
different from a few decades ago. Nevertheless, most of us look at the
[troubles](https://grist.org/article/gertz-inuit/) of the
[world](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/opinion/26kristof.html?)
and feel more or less hopeless than any social change will ever lessen the
suffering and degradation of more than a small handful of any given populace.
But change does occur. Legalized slavery was abolished in the United States.
Citizens stopped hunting for witches. Democratic movements swept over the
Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon. Gandhi and King preached non-violence,
and with non-violence achieved at least the first vital steps toward
realizing their dreams. How this change comes about is the topic of an
excellent essay, albeit one in need of some tightening, called
[The Six or Seven Axioms of Social Change](https://newstories.org/resources/the-six-or-seven-axioms-of-social-change/).

## The Axioms

The essay begins with Margaret Mead's Axiom, "Never doubt that a
small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world; indeed,
it's the only thing that ever has." The author goes on to suggest
that social change is a networked, non-linear process wherein that small
group creates an environment succeptible to change until a "tipping
point" is reached (to use Gladwell's phrase). I count 5 specific
axioms of social change laid out:

* Change happens
* A stuck system is like a black hole
* The first move towards change is usually undemocratic
* The group is smarter (but not braver) than the individual
* Ideas (and viruses) acquire people through small worlds

I'll let you read the rest for yourselves. I'm getting lazy. Or
just tired.

## Grassroots and Leadership

The interplay between grassroots and leadership (in the traditional sense)
would be an interesting one to explore. Thinking about Lincoln, for example:
we know there was a strong grassroots abolition movement, and we know that
this movement effected (infected?) Lincoln through his wife. But it was the
vision of Lincoln that pushed the idea over the hill. It was his added
strength, from a (humble) position of power that made the end of legal
slavery in the USA possible. The group may have been smarter, but it was
useless without him.

Is this universally true? Will the grassroots ever be capable of tipping
the balance without one (or a few) key people from positions of power lending
their support? Perhaps the Bolshevik revolution shows a fully
grassroots-induced mass social change (please correct if I'm wrong), but
that was through violence and it exacerbated massive suffering for people
already ground down by the Tsar and wars with Japan, Britain, and Germany.
Questions about the worth of communism aside, I pre-suppose that
"violence is not the answer."

I have just recently came upon these "earth-aware" websites. It seems many indiviudals in the world (specifically American culture) are ignorant to the increasingly negative events occuring around our planet. It's inspiring and amazing that there truly are individuals in the world who want to make a change, and believe strongly in their own spheres of influence. Thanks for helping to save our world...may we all come together and make a true change in the things that need the most aid. I'm very interested in NGO's, or any other organizations or even individuals that want to make positive change. Please notify me for further support, or even help with any of your ideas. I desire to be more actively involved and expand my knowledge. Let peace pervade, Amber
