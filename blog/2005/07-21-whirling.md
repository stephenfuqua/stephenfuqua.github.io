Are those devils or dervishes dancing on my wingtips?
I can't deny a certain... \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty... \
To it all;

Grace is not found in riveted \
Planes of steelâ€” \
Even the birds register disapproval, \
But perhaps its in a lonely red dot \
Awash amidst gray and white, \
Or maybe, yes, certainly \
In the majesty of suspension while \
Earth rolls 'round and 'round.
