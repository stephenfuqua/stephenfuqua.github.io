An interesting little discussion on the intersection of science and religion has
unfolded in _Special relativity and the Bahá’í Faith_ (dead link removed; SF
2025). In references in _Some Answered Questions_ and elsewhere,
'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; speaks of "ether," a concept that was abandoned by the
majority of scientists with the acceptance of Einstein's special relativity. The
question then is, which should we adhere to? The religious truth or the
scientific one?

Fortunately I believe this is a false dichotomy, at least in this specific
situation. Despite having a masters degree in physics, I’ve never been bothered
by the "ether" quotation. For example, 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; writes:

> "Reflect that light is the expression of the vibrations of the etheric matter:
> the nerves of the eye are affected by these vibrations, and sight is produced.
> The light of the lamp exists through the vibration of the etheric matter; so
> also does that of the sun, but what a difference between the light of the sun
> and that of the stars or the lamp!"

But reference to "ether" is not made here from the standpoint of a holy man
proclaiming the truth of a scientific concept. Rather, He explains the state of
science (rather well, I might add), and goes on to use the relative intensity
and energy of sun light compared to lamp light — both of which interact with
animal eyes in the same fashion — as an analogy for a spiritual concept.
Understanding the spiritual concept is what matters here, not the state of
science 100 years after the above was uttered.

Though this is admittedly but one sample from the many science-referencing
quotations from the Central Figures, it seems to me that the majority of such
statements are intended to construct a semblance of a picture of spiritual
reality — that is, they are not intended to absolutely accurately describe
physical reality. Indeed, in a letter to an individual believer, the Universal
House of Justice wrote that:
