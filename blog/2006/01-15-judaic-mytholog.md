I was recently watching a show on PBS wherein the narrator was traveling the
lands of ancient Canaan, illustrating the paths of Abraham in the book of
Genesis. At one point he and his guide climbed a slope next to the Dead Sea,
and, having entered a tunnel in the cliff-side, found themselves staring up an
immense shaft blasted by salt. Due to a confluence of geographic and climactic
factors, the pressure from the Sea will often push great fountains of salt up
from the seabed through this shaft, and thence cover the plains above the cliff.

These very plains are one of the rumored locations of the ancient cities of
Sodom and Gomorrah. The film crew left the tunnels and returned to the cliff top
plains. The land was harsh; the uneducated eye would have no idea that salt
covered all, preventing growth. Was this spray of salt perhaps the origin of the
Bible's story of the destruction of these cities? Even more interesting to me,
however, was the _pillar of salt_ that the crew passed – just bigger than a
person. "But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt" (Gen
19:26). Could this be she?

The show was relatively well balanced, largely looking
at the Bible as a historical record but also acknowledging the
possible/probable mythological status of many of its stories. Personally, I
have long considered stories such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah to
be mythological. But what I suddenly realized on this occasion was that,
having been raised initially with the belief that these tales were
historically accurate but later abandoning them, I had never fully considered
the significance of this Judaic mythology in terms of explanations of natural
phenomenon.

It has always been easy to see elements of natural but unexplainable occurrences
in Greek and Norse mythology, for instance, but I had never thought about them
in the Judaic (or Egyptian, for that matter). But here we have a woman becoming
a pillar of salt, and I realized that this is the exact same genre of mythology
as the legend of Daphne turning into a laurel-tree to escape the pursuit of
Apollo. Realizing this, I think I've come to see the ancient Hebrews in a little
more _earthly_ perspective. I've always rationally known that their mythology
was not as wholly unique as it appears today, but this realization forged a new
intuitive link between this ancient society and others.

One might expect that this minor epiphany might cause me
to lose some respect for the Hebrew people and their plight through the ages.
On the contrary, it actually makes me see the books of the Old Testament in a
fresh light. Whereas for long I had dismissed them as _mere myth_, I now
see them as doorways into an ancient culture – just as I had already
come to see the _mythos_ of the Greeks and the sagas of the Norse. But
unlike the legends and fables of these cultures, the tales of Abraham, his
ancestors and descendants, live on today both as living stories and the
cultural underpinnings for all the great religions of the West (including
[my own](/bahai/)).
