Breathing, eating, sleeping. Typing, gardening, speaking. These things Evolution's end &mdash; but not my own. Life begets life, begets continuous wonder and love. Ambition brings no love, births no wonder nor praise for the Universe. Life must be praise, not ambition. Must be love, must be passion mixed with sense mixed with openness. Open to the Mysteries, open to the wide skies above the plain and deep places hidden in the gorge. Open to the divine. Praise be to Thee, O Universe of limitless perfection. Grant that I may Live for Thee.
