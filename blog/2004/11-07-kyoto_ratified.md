The Kyoto Protocol has been ratified by Russia (dead link removed; SF 2025). What happens now?
What changes will we see, what effects will it have on the United States, and
what comes next?

## Implementation

Now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has formally signed the Protocol, it
must be delivered to the United Nations in New York City. Its requirements will
go into effect 90 days after receipt. Specifically, the [treaty's
text](https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol) calls signatories to implement policies such as:

* Enhancement of energy efficiency in relevant sectors of the national
economy;

* Protection and enhancement of sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases
not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, taking into account its
commitments under relevant international environmental agreements;
promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and
reforestation;

* Promotion of sustainable forms of agriculture in light of climate
change considerations;

* Research on, and promotion, development and increased use of, new and
renewable forms of energy, of carbon dioxide sequestration technologies and
of advanced and innovative environmentally sound technologies;

* Progressive reduction or phasing out of market imperfections, fiscal
incentives, tax and duty exemptions and subsidies in all greenhouse gas
emitting sectors that run counter to the objective of the Convention and
application of market instruments;

* Encouragement of appropriate reforms in relevant sectors aimed at
promoting policies and measures which limit or reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol;

* Measures to limit and/or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases not
controlled by the Montreal Protocol in the transport sector;

* Limitation and/or reduction of methane emissions through recovery and
use in waste management, as well as in the production, transport and
distribution of energy;

Kyoto also calls for specific reductions in greenhouse gases while providing a
method for countries to trade reduction credits &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a process
expected to bring a bonus revenue to Russia, whose emissions have declined along
with its economy since the original negotiations in 1992. Britain's Climate
Change Projects Office provides the following examples of climate change
projects (dead links removed; SF 2025) expected to occur in Britain:

* Use of renewable energy rather than fossil fuels for electricity generation (e.g. a wind farm)
* Use of a lower carbon intensive form of fossil fuel energy (e.g. installation of a combined cycle gas power station where coal-fired power stations are usual)
* More efficient use of energy (e.g. the use of more energy efficient lamps)
* Management of biodegradable waste (e.g. the capture and use of landfill gas to generate electricity, rather than allowing it to vent to the atmosphere and needing to use fossil fuels to generate electricity)
* A change to an industrial process to reduce the release of greenhouse gases (e.g. a change in the way cement is manufactured)
* Long term storage of carbon (e.g. by sequestering it in trees, or storing it underground, for example in cavities left after oil extraction)

## Effects on the United States

Changing laws overseas affect multinational U.S. corporations (dead link
removed; SF 2025) (such as Ford and Alcoa), who may bring their changes home
instead of creating a complex patchwork of internal policies. Heightened demand
for cleaner equipment could result in lower prices in the long run, thus making
clean manufacturing and production processes more economically feasible.

While a change of heart is not forthcoming (dead link removed; SF 2025) from the
newly re-elected President, one can hope that Russia's actions will renew
domestic interest in working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, though the fact
that their signing came during election season doomed the news to relative
obscurity stateside. Perhaps the [Climate Stewardship
Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Stewardship_Acts), championed by John
McCain and Joe Lieberman, will finally manage to receive a hearing on the Senate
floor. While to environmentalists it does not go far enough, it is considered a
step in the right direction.

Several individual states have also begun taking matters into their own hands;
California's Air Resources Board is leading the way with [new
regulations](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/news/arb-approves-greenhouse-gas-rule) requiring lower vehicle
emissions by 2009. With standards already higher than the rest of the nation,
perhaps California's laws will push more reductions statewide
&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; from a policy leadership perspective and from the
difficulty in manufacturing and marketing cars specific to California.

## The Future

Data showing the truth (dead link removed; SF 2025) and probable impact  (dead
link removed; SF 2025) of global warming continues to pour in, though the once
and future Administration also continues to play down that data  (dead link
removed; SF 2025) and even attempt to suppress it to some extent, according to
other countries involved in major multilateral research.

The Kyoto Protocol is only the first step in international efforts to reverse
the tide of climate change. [Talks will soon begin](https://unfccc.int/event/buenos-aires-climate-change-conference-december-2004) on
the next steps, which include further reductions and bringing the developing
world into the fold (lack of enforcement on the developing world has been one of
the Bush administration's complaints).

Climate change is, of course, only [one piece of the environmental
enigma](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3971019.stm). Loss of
biodiversity, land degradation, access to fresh water, and other issues have
been argued to be key issues inflaming local tensions across the globe. Working
to solve these problems is an increasingly important component of the
international peace movement. Some are even calling for creation of a [World
Environment
Organisation](https://theconversation.com/why-is-there-still-no-world-environment-organisation-25792)
(dead link replaced with newer one; SF 2025) as a complement to the World Trade
Organization.
