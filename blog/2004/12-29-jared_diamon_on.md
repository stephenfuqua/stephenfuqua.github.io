Go read Jared Diamond's (author of _Guns, Germs, and Steel_) report in _Harper's
Magazine_, [The last Americans: environmental collapse and the end of
civilization](https://harpers.org/archive/2003/06/the-last-americans/). Then
donate a few dollars to the Red Cross or other aid agencies working in South
Asia (tangentially connected, but it must be said). From the report:

> One of the disturbing facts of history is that so many civilizations collapse.
> Few people, however, least of all our politicians, realize that a primary
> cause of the collapse of those societies has been the destruction of the
> environmental resources on which they depended. Fewer still appreciate that
> many of those civilizations share a sharp curve of decline. Indeed, a
> society's demise may begin only a decade or two after it reaches its peak
> population, wealth, and power.
