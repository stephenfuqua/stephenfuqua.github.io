I understand that this is, for many, a large and complex issue that deserves
real thought and consideration. I welcome the debate in the Senate, and  trust
that this august body will realize that  a "marriage amendment" is not in
keeping with the spirit and text of the Constitution of the United
States&mdash;the most powerful secular document ever conceived.  I acknowledge
that there are instances where the federal government must act to protect the
public safety and in doing so, moral questions do at times come up.
Nevertheless, I cannot see that the banning of "gay marriages" is a matter for
federal jurisdiction or concern; I cannot see that it is a matter of such
overwhelming importance to the continued functioning of our society that it
should be enshrined in our Constitution.

The above is the custom text that I inserted into a form letter to Senators
Hutchison and Cornyn a few minutes ago, through the National [Organization of Women](http://www.now.org) (NOW). Debate was moved up
to begin today (assuredly a politically motivated move in this election season).
I do not quarrel with those who propose this amendment, I do not feel there is
anything partisan in this message. Rather I am letting my representatives know
my feelings on the matter and urge all to do so as well (even if you support the
Defense of Marriage Act).

Here is the complete text of the letter I sent through NOW:

> I join with the National Organization for Women in urging you to vote against
> the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment (S.J.Res. 30).
>
> I am strongly opposed to amending the Constitution for the sole purpose of
> restricting the rights of any individual, regardless of their sex or sexual
> orientation. Amending the Constitution to deny same-sex couples the right to
> marry is a profound betrayal of the democratic principles which are the basis
> of that document. Equal treatment, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment
> of the Constitution must be sacrosanct: Individuals must be assured the same
> rights and responsibilities, regardless of their sexual orientation.
>
> I understand that this is, for many, a large and complex issue that deserves
> real thought and consideration. I welcome the debate in the Senate, and  trust
> that this august body will realize that  a "marriage amendment" is not in
> keeping with the spirit and text of the Constitution of the United States--the
> most powerful secular document ever conceived.

> I acknowledge that there are instances where the federal government must act

> up. Nevertheless, I cannot see that the banning of "gay marriages" is a matter
> for federal jurisdiction or concern; I cannot see that it is a matter of such
> overwhelming importance to the continued functioning of our society that it
> should be enshrined in our Constitution.
>
> I urge you not to be among those senators who vote in favor of an amendment
> that would write discrimination into the United States Constitution for the
> first time in history.

> Sincerely,
> Stephen A. Fuqua
