As a teenager &mdash; and perhaps beyond &mdash; I thought I might achieve some
great thing in this world. I wished for recognition, aspired for greatness and
some exalted place, to strive with Tennyson's gods...

My dreams were of the Nobel Prize (physics), or poet laureate; of stardom on the
soccer field or the rock stage; even dreams of the Presidency. Though practical
reality was never truly far from my thoughts, one cannot say my hubris lacked imagination.
And at its core, I always saw this striving as a singular thing done by individual
men (in the neutral sense; I've always been for equal opportunity). 

The dream of the Presidency was the first to go; great achievement in physics
was the last. Ever since the first time I nearly dropped out of graduate school
(which actually occurred the day _before_ registering for classes), I have
struggled to gain a coherent vision for what I might do with my life. Perhaps my
oldest and most resilient dream was to be a tweed-clad professor of physics (or
philosophy or ...), leading classes, publishing, attending salons with other
great minds. But when I began to question the very idea of getting a graduate degree
in physics, the track I had laid before myself as a senior in high school, I felt
utterly lost. 

I still feel lost at times, but at nearly 28 I feel that I am getting a bit closer
to figuring out what I'll do with my life. Most importantly, I now see my place
not as some singularly important leader, but rather as one of the countless nodes
working to reshape humanity. Just as I now see an interconnected network of life
all around me instead of fundamental particles, I now see a network of actors in
the social domain, each striving with gods, with but few achieving "some work of
noble note" before their own deaths. It is the striving that I value now, with
or without the global recognition I once sought, and the knowledge that others
are working toward the goals I now hold dear: "[to] create cultures of peace, justice
and healing for the Earth and all living beings." (<a href="http://www.uri.org">URI
charter</a>).  

Within this network, I see myself acting from an eco-religious perspective (I'll
explain that one some time), working to reshape humanity and achieve sustainability,
social justice, and a more harmonious, unified society. A tall order to be sure,
but one that my faith tells me is attainable. 

And thus I announce a true name for this blog: _Conscientia_. In Latin
the word means "joint knowledge." The purpose is not for me to share _my_ wisdom
and knowledge &mdash; for what small matter I may possess is but gleaned or inspired
by those before and around me, and in no greater measure than anyone else. Rather,
it is to share what knowledge I may encounter as I strive to learn from those who
would share with me, and invite a further sharing and spreading of wisdom through
the occasional or even frequent comment below.  

Eleanor Roosevelt once declared that "the future belongs to those who believe
in the beauty of their dreams." Though I may be a bit more cynical, a bit less
dreamy, and hopefully more mature than the dreams of my high school days, I still
believe in their beauty. Rather than a beauty of achievement, it is now the beauty
of order arising from our chaos &mdash; of unity in diversity, of individual threads
weaving a gorgeous tapestry together.
