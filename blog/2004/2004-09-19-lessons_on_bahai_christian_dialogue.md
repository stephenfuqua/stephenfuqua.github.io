As an active Bah&aacute;'&iacute; on campus in the mid-to-late 90's, I often
found myself engaged in intriguing but sometimes pointless discussions with
various Christians. The Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith, progressing from an Islamic
milieu, shares a good deal of religious worldview with that faith. Thus in ["A
note on Muslim-Christian dialogue"]( http://underprogress.blogs.com/weblog/2004/08/a_small_note_on.html) one could almost directly substitute the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith for Islam.

It is well worth reading the entire, well-informed treatment. Thebit (the
author), himself commenting on other comments about Muslim-Christian dialogue (

3</a>), notes "The assumptions which exist on both sides conducting comparative
religious analysis, stifle discussions to the point where they are talking over
each other" (that's what I mean by "pointless"). He goes on to make a basic
&mdash; but crucial &mdash; point about the difference between Muslims and
Christians in understanding the concepts of "revelation" and "prophet."

On revelation:

> "For the Muslim, "revelation" is an experience which only a prophetic figure
> undergoes. ... This revelation between the Divine and the individual (through
> whatever 'mechanism') produces a principal "text" (the "Word of God"); as well
> as, according to various Muslim authorities, his other deeds and sayings
> (usually classified under his sunnah). In this way the prophet is the vehicle
> of the revelation; but his own activity, though distinguished from the actual
> revelation, is still strongly bound up with the it."
>
> "'revelation' is different for most Christians. 'Revelation' can imply a form
> of inspiration under Divine guidance limited not just to prophetic figures.
> Any &mdash; religious or pious &mdash; individual can receive "revelation" in
> this way."

On prophets or messengers:

> "From this follows the flip-side of the dialogue which is often pushed
> heavily by certain Christian missionaries: that Jesus is comparable to
> Muhammad (pbut). But this must be a Muslim understanding. For, in the
> eyes of the Christian, Jesus (p) must be more than merely human. To the
> Muslim, however, Muhammad is only human (despite the high esteem he is
> held in by Muslims), and this he believes is the same for Jesus (p)."

These very problems I had noted during my days of "dialogue" on the West
Mall at UT, but I was never able to recognize or state them so well, nor
was I able to find a way for my dialogue partner and I to mutually
explore these divides in a constructive manner.

Naturally it was always my view that I was working to bridge the gap and
the other person was being completely inflexible. But then again, I was
refusing to see Christ as "Godhead," which became a singular point of
contention &mdash; a point I don't recall trying very hard to
circumnavigate.

Thebit, however, offers some ideas for using this problem as a positive
point of dialogue, instead of a point of debate. Further, I have a
feeling that a distinctive Bah&aacute;'&iacute; approach could be found
to help bridge this gap.

On the one hand, Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h makes a clear statement about
the fundamental reality of God and His independent, peerless nature:

> "The Person of the Manifestation hath ever been the representative and
> mouthpiece of God. He, in truth, is the Day Spring of God's most excellent
> Titles, and the Dawning-Place of His exalted Attributes. If any be set up by
> His side as peers, if they be regarded as identical with His Person, how can
> it, then, be maintained that the Divine Being is One and Incomparable, that
> His Essence is indivisible and peerless? Meditate on that which We have,
> through the power of truth, revealed unto thee, and be thou of them that
> comprehend its meaning." (<a href="
> http://www.safnet.com/bahai/writings/gleanings/GWB-28.html" title=" Gleanings
> from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, Section XXVII">Gleanings, XXVIII</a>)

However, Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute; also makes a clear statement about the
distinct status of the Manifestations (prophets, messengers). While many
passages attest to this stature, the very next section in Gleanings gives it
thusly:

> "It should, however, be borne in mind that God and His Manifestation can,
> under no circumstances, be dissociated from the loftiness and sublimity which
> They inherently possess. Nay, loftiness and sublimity are themselves the
> creations of His Word, if ye choose to see with My sight not with yours." (<a
> href=" http://www.safnet.com/bahai/writings/gleanings/GWB-29.html" title="
> Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, Section XXIX">Gleanings, XXIX</a>)

Proceeding through the _Gleanings_&hellip;

> "... We recognize in the manifestation of each one of them, whether outwardly
> or inwardly, the manifestation of none but God Himself, if ye be of those that
> comprehend. Every one of them is a mirror of God, reflecting naught else but
> His Self, His Beauty, His Might and Glory, if ye will understand. All else
> besides them are to be regarded as mirrors capable of reflecting the glory of
> these Manifestations Who are themselves the Primary Mirrors of the Divine
> Being, if ye be not devoid of understanding." (<a href="
> http://www.safnet.com/bahai/writings/gleanings/GWB-30.html" title=" Gleanings
> from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, Section XXX">Gleanings, XXX</a>)

Thus it was that, while I may have tried to introduce this concept as a
point of dialogue, perhaps it would have been more constructive to try
moving the conversation forward by saying "I'll grant, for now, the
divinity of Christ, if you'll grant that I believe
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h occupies a similar station. Now, how can we
build a constructive reality together? Are there points of disagreement
that will keep us from working together? This point will clearly keep us
from converting each other, so let us acknowledge it and set it aside."

Of course this is but one approach to stepping around this point in
dialogue. Another statement could be made about the equivalence of these
two these two Prophets, i.e. second coming, but my experience is that
this idea throws up a lot of veils and can be an insurmountable statement
in a sincere attempt at dialogue (note "dialogue," not "conversion").
