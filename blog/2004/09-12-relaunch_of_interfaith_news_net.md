## The Parliament of the World's Religions Results in Thousands of Commitments to Address Religious Violence and Other Urgent Issues Facing the World

The Parliament of the World's Religions&mdash;the
oldest modern tradition of international interfaith dialogue&mdash;recently
convened in Barcelona, Spain. Sadly InterfaithNews.Net was not able to
cover the event in person. With over 8,000 souls in attendance, it seems
to have been a phenomenal success. But can that success be translated into meaningful
activity outside of Barcelona? Many of the participants believe so. Read
on for the final press release from the Parliament, highlighting important committments
to interfaith work on Religious Violence, External (International) Debt,
Water, and Refugees.

## Impressions from the Parliament

In our last issue, sent out just prior
to the Parliament, we requested personal responses from the attendees.
Read on for a collection of the best individual and institutional responses
we've received.

## College of Preachers' Abrahamic Fellows Confront Religious Violence    The College of Preachers at Washington

National Cathedral organized and hosted an unprecedented Abrahamic residency

Stendahl, Rabbi Marc Gopin, and Abdulaziz Sachedina was to plumb the doctrinal,

to counteract them.

## Hands Across Jordan

Creating a Bridge of Peace Across the Jordan River
Can a group of passionate activists from a small town in California really do
anything about the retributions, recrimnations, and violence in the Middle East?
An initiative called "Hands Across the Jordan" seeks to find out. Their intention
is to build a bridge of peace across the Jordan River, with help from all around
the world, to help unite the people of Israel and Jordan in a grassroots effort.
Here is their statement.

## Importance of Religious Pluralism: a Hindu Perspective

Hinduism may be the world's oldest religion, although it might be more appropriate
to call it a collection of religious traditions. In that vein, it may also be
the most pluralistic religion on the planet. Taking lessons from his Hindu faith,
Jay Lakhani of the Vivekananda Centre in London, UK, shares reflections on the
nature of pluralism.

## Indigenous Perspectives on the United Religions Initiative

The URI's Sally Mahe writes: "Raul Mamani, one of the leaders of the Indigenous
People MCC in Latin America, took an extended trip in October and November
2003 through the Andes to visit with indigenous people - to listen to their ideas
and to share ideas about the URI. Attached, please find Raul's warm-hearted
and inspiring report of his experiences and conversations."
