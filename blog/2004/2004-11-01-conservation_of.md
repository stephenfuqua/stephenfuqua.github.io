Thus begins "Water Conservation as a Religious Duty".

The _Yemen Observer_ is carrying an [intriguing article](http://www.yobserver.com/news/article_2650.html) on
the need to conserve water in that desert country. As with so many things in
Arabic culture, there are abundant appeals to Islamic religion in this call,
pointing out that in the traditions Muhammad (peace be upon Him) bade His
followers to not be overly indulgent even in their ablutions.

There are several interesting things going on here. On the one hand, I find this
to be the most striking Islamic support for an environmental position that I
have seen, and I applaud it. I wish more religious individuals would use the
clear mandate in their sacred texts to encourage more sustainable behavior.

Another thing I find interesting is the authorship: the Ministry of Environment.
Could the Secretary of the Interior get a (non-religious) equivalent printed in
the paper in the United States? Perhaps as an op-ed; however, this is actually
listed as the lead article in the Environment section of the paper. (I'm rather
impressed that they have such a section). There's just no way an American paper
would do such a thing. I'm not judging the Yemeni paper, just pointing out the
difference.

Finally, the religious tone of this missive again goes to show the difference
between an average Arabic government and western governments.

Oh, one more thing: it is probably significant that this article is coming out
during Ramadan, a time of the highest emphasis on religious duty, a time that I
imagine is filled with even more prayer than usual, and perhaps even more
ablutions.

_Please pardon my haste. I need to finish determining for whom I am voting in
the local elections in the morning, but I want to get this post out immediately
anyway._
