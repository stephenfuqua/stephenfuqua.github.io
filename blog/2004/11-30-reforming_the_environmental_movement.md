At WorldChanging, Alex Steffen offers up excellent suggestions on reforming the
environmental movement in his article Reframing the Planet (dead link removed;
SF 2025), asking, "Environmentalism has been getting sand kicked in its face on
the political beach for too long now. How do we beef it up?". Answering his own
question, Steffen offers the beginnings of concrete ways that the greens can
appeal to the American public.

Before my iBook was stolen, I had an essay in the works about the relationship
of the environmental and interfaith/religious movements. Sadly that piece is
gone and I've not had time to reformulate it. Below are two of the central
points I was working towards.

1. I have the feeling that the partisanship of today's grassroots environmental
   organizations is counter-productive. Organizations that take direct stances
   on who should be elected, for instance, will never be able to reach out past
   the red/blue divide in the U.S.
2. I would suggest that one avenue of future environmental activism should be
   through religious organizations. Most of the world's religions have some
   strong stewardship message, if not a stronger green message. What better way
   for religions and environmentalists to both burnish their images and reach
   across cultural divides? Work together, building trust and understanding,
   realizing that many people listen to their pastors more readily than to the
   executive director of the Sierra Club.
