"When you look at marriage, it's between a man and a woman," Ms. Goldford said.
"Biblically, homosexuality isn't in the plan." (today's [New York
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/national/04gays.html?hp)). I'm sorry Ms. Goldford, but we do not live in a theocracy. Please
base your vote on secular arguments. Unfortunately I'm too late for my
elementary-years-state-of-residence: Missouri voters have approved a
constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between a man and a woman.
And probably based mostly on the simple religious truism above.
