I have a couple of article recommendations for you all*: <a href=
"http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/6/mooney-science.asp">Blinded By Science: How
'Balanced' Coverage Lets the Scientific Fringe Hijack Reality</a>; <a href=
"http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040920&amp;s=zinn">The Optimism of
Uncertainty</a>. Plus a few small comments&hellip;

<!-- truncate -->

The issue of "balance" in scientific reporting is one I've
noticed for years, particularly with regard to climate change: while maybe 1
out of 100 (probably far fewer) reputable climate scientists think
there's nothing to worry about, the reports tend to give equal credit to
that 1 as they do to the 1 worried scientist they quote. Completely
misleading, and a big reason why this country doesn't seem to understand
the ramifications of climate change.

I originally noticed the _Blinded By Science_ article over at [WorldChanging](http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/001562.html),
where I left the following comment:

> It may be that the best way to counter this is for the scientists to
> actively call the media out when they give too much credit to scientists
> who have not passed the peer review muster, who exist on the fringes. So we
> who have a clue about science should be vigilant and ready to respond with
> letters to the editor in all times and places.
>
> Conservation biologists in particular are learning that, when it comes
> to enacting real policies, science cannot ignore the human elements;
> "objective science" becomes useless without understanding the
> broader ramifications of scientific findings. Peer review helps keep
> science pointed in the right direction; expert review (of non peer
> journalists) should help steer reporting and policy in the right
> direction.

A friend sent me the second link, whose opening line grabbed me as a
_very_ familiar question:

> In this awful world where the efforts of caring people often pale in
> comparison to what is done by those who have power, how do I manage to stay
> involved and seemingly happy?

Let me add one more quote to assure you of the worthiness of this quick
read:

> Revolutionary change does not come as one cataclysmic moment (beware of
> such moments!) but as an endless succession of surprises, moving zigzag
> toward a more decent society. We don't have to engage in grand, heroic
> actions to participate in the process of change. Small acts, when
> multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world. Even when we
> don't "win," there is fun and fulfillment in the fact that we
> have been involved, with other good people, in something worthwhile. We
> need hope.
