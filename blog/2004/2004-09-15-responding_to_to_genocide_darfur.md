Just as a negotiated-peace began to take hold in southern Sudan, a new crisis
arose in the western Darfur region this past winter and spring. Half a year
after escalation of the atrocities, estimates of the dead range from 30,000 to
50,000, and well over a million people have been internally or externally
displaced. Men and boys have been systematically murdered; worse yet, a
conscious effort at genocide has once again turned to mass rape of the remaining
women. International response has been harsh yet guarded, and far too slow. We
must push our political leaders to appropriate action under international law.

### Current Situation

By now we have all heard about the <a href="http://www.savedarfur.org/"
title="Background Information from the Save Darfur Campaign">atrocities and
genocide</a> occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan. I first heard of them in
the editorials of Nicolas Kristof of _The New York Times_ back in March, shortly
after they began. While there have been a few references in this news source (<a
href="http://www.interfaithnews.net/index.php?module=announce&ANN_user_op=view&ANN_id=85"
title="InterfaithNews.Net coverage of remarks from Kofi Annan">1</a>, <a
href="http://www.interfaithnews.net/index.php?module=announce&ANN_user_op=view&ANN_id=11"
title="InterfaithNews.Net Editorial">2</a>), not enough attention has been paid
to this issue that should be paramount for religionists the world over.

For the past few months the world has argued about how to respond, how to**
prevent over a million refugees from becoming another million deaths from
genocide in Africa**. In the meantime atrocities have continued, and the
government of Sudan has not kept its promises to halt the harassment. In a scene
reminiscent of legal wrangling over the definition of "is" in the mid-90's, the
international community has thus far refused to use the legal term "genocide" to
describe the murders, rapes, and displacement of people. As if we need a legal
distinction to realize that action is needed! Finally this past week the U.S.
Secretary of State, Colin Powell, definitely <a
href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1094767834669&call_pageid=968332188854&col=968350060724"
title="Article from the Toronto Star (Canada)">ascribed the term "genocide"</a>
to the government backed oppression.

Does this mean that action under the international <a
href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm" title="Text of the
Convention via UNHCR web site">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
the Crime of Genocide</a> is imminent? Perhaps the U.S. government will for once
help deliver military assistance to African victims of genocide. According to a
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/09/20040909-10.html"
title="White House Press Release">September 9th press release</a> from the White
House, the government plans to seek "**a new [United Nations] Security Council
Resolution to authorize an expanded African Union security force to prevent
further bloodshed.**" These strong words have been backed by introduction of a
<a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_11-9-2004_pg4_4"
title="Article from the Daily Times (Pakistan)">draft resolution</a> that, if
objections from Russia, France and China can be accommodated, may pass as soon
as this week.

At last we have positive movement towards ameliorating the violence. But what
about the continuing humanitarian crisis &mdash; the need for food, water,
shelter, and the return of refugees? **This is where the international community
must work diligently to safeguard these lives, to keep keep the death toll from
becoming a chaotic downward spiral.**

### Relief Efforts

International donors and the U.N. have been at work since the beginning of refugee
movements last winter, and a donor's conference for fundraising is planned for
late in September in Oslo, Norway. Many religious and interfaith organizations
have joined (or lead) the efforts, though some are worried that the recent focus
on Darfur will hurt similar efforts in the newly peaceful southern regions. The <a href="http://www.uri.org/abouturi/charter/" title="... as expressed in the URI charter">spiritual
imperative</a> to assist those is need is clear and present in all major religions,
so I will not belabor that point. As individuals and organizations,** here
are a few concrete ways that you can help:**
<ol>
<li>Raise your voice, electronically that is, by sharing this urgent message with
your religious brethren and administrative or clerical officials or by joining
the Save Darfur Coalition's <a href="http://www.savedarfur.org/go.php?q=greenRibbonCampaign.html">Green
Ribbon Campaign</a></li>
<li>Those of you who live in nations represented on the U.N. Security Council:
please urge your governments to support military force and/or the threat of economic
sanctions in Sudan (Permanent/veto members: China, France, Great Britain, Russia,
United States; At-large members: Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Germany,
Pakistan, Philippines, Romania, and Spain)</li>
<li>Contribute directly to humanitarian relief through the groups below.</li>

### The [Save Darfur](http://www.savedarfur.org) Coalition

"The Save Darfur Coalition, comprised of a broadly diverse group of faith-based,
humanitarian and human rights organizations, was formed to raise public
awareness and to mobilize North Americans and members of the international
community to respond to and help end the atrocities that threaten the lives of
two million people in the Darfur region." (from [savedarfur.org](http://www.savedarfur.org/go.php?q=theCoalition.html))


Inspired by a speech by Nobel-prize winner Elie Wiesel, this group has brought
together over 100 organizations, truly representing every major religion in the
United States, in support of a unity statement regarding the need to respond to
the events in Darfur. They are working to spread the word through congregations
and campuses in particular, and are trying to organize a "green ribbon campaign"
for grassroots spread of their message.

I do not know how effective they have been to date (I found them only after
actively searching for Darfur relief efforts), but their intentions, aims, and
actions seem to be of utmost purity and profoundly meaningful.
**InterfaithNews.Net will join the Save Darfur Coalition green ribbon campaign,
and we'd like to use our "pulpit" to urge other religious and interfaith groups
to do so as well. **
