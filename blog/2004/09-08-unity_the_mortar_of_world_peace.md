The concept of world peace is surely not new to you. The idea that it
just might come about &mdash; now that is a revolutionary concept.

Every day we hear more depressing news: from natural disasters to
terrorism to another child kidnapping. When it comes to religion, many
folks simply walk away, blaming religions for these problems, or refusing
to believe in a "god" who could allow these things to occur.
But the world's secular institutions don't seem to be doing much
better. Some say the U.S. holds too much power&hellip others that it doesn't
exercise enough. The United Nations, while successful in some things, has
been largely powerless in places like Rwanda, Bosnia, and the Middle
East. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund collectively,
depending on whom you ask, are either the greatest salvation for the
developing world or the biggest enemy of democracy and sustainability. Sting spoke for much
of the Western world when he sang "People say I've lost my
faith in the politicians."

And amidst all of this turmoil, a small religion out of nineteenth century Iran
is slowly gaining strength. You see, this religion &mdash; the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith &mdash;  believes that these troubles are, in the
words of Shoghi Effendi, "the rumblings of that catastrophic upheaval, which is
to proclaim, at one and the same time, the death-pangs of the old order and the
birth-pangs of the new&hellip;" The Iraq question*, war in Chechnya, famine in
Malawi, poverty in the Rio Grande _colonias_ &mdash;  these are all the death
pangs of a collapsing world order.

And what shall bring our redemption? According to the Universal House of
Justice, "world peace, a hallmark of the emerging global civilization, will be
realized as a tangible expression of the principle of the oneness of humankind."

Thus it is that Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s believe that the
establishment of the principle of the oneness of humankind (unity) in the
minds, hearts, and actions of men and women the world over, is necessary
for us to finally reach the hallowed promise of world peace.

A few questions to ponder:

1. What does the "oneness of humankind" mean?
1. Tangibly, what does it mean to promote this principle?
1. What are the causes of failure amongst the world's secular institutions?
1. What is one thing you could do this very week to promote world peace?
