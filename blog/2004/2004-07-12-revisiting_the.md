As a matter of religious conviction &mdash;and standard English language [definition](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=marriage)&mdash; I
have never felt that the term "gay marriage" meant much of anything, and would,
perhaps, even call it an oxymoron. When the government, however, tries to step
in and reinforce that definition with legal statutes, I immediately react
against it as an unwarranted and discriminatory encroachment upon civil rights.

<!-- truncate -->

To be fair, there was until recently nothing to encroach upon &mdash;there was
no practical right or ability for a non-man/woman relationship to be legally
recognized. We all know that. And yet, just as with the now-banned anti-sodomy
laws, this never sat well with me.

The legal institution of marriage brings dignity and respect to the couple;
confers legal benefits, rights, and responsibilities (parental, health,
survivorship); and promotes monogamous relationships as a stabilizing agent
within society.

I am willing to give that dignity and respect to my (admittedly few) gay
friends, as much as I am to any random couple in America. I'll grant that there
is probably a majority in America that do not now and never will give equal
respect to a gay couple&mdash;but that is not a reason to deny access to a legal
institution. Undoubtedly a pithy comparison to the Civil Rights movement could
be made here, but such broad metaphors are all too often the device of
demagogues.

The rights and responsibilities of a spouse largely stem from the traditional
familial relationships: father working, mother cleaning, kids at school, etc.
But the second plank has changed considerably. Society too has changed, both
apart from and in reaction with women joining the work force in greater numbers.
No longer is it necessary for a women to stay at home, and no longer is their a
strong societal need for high levels of procreation (considered true at one time
by those who wished to fill America from coast-to-coast with Europeans, and true
again today with nations such as [Italy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2472845.stm)). Thus if
we are to continue granting spousal rights, why deny them for gay couples? This
does, I admit, presuppose a mindset of some openness, tolerance,
progressivism&mdash;whatever you want to call it.

The past several years have brought the issue of homosexuality to the fore of
national attention. In the 1990's the [Matthew
Shepard](http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&edition=us&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22matthew+shepard%22) case showed the extremes of hatred for gays. The [rise
in the rate](http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-02-11-hiv-rates-rising_x.htm) of HIV/AIDS infections amongst straights forced the pundits to
realize that AIDS is not solely " the wrath of God upon homosexuals." Texas's
anti-sodomy laws shocked  those who did not know about them, and the [Supreme Court's
decision](http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/06/26/scotus.sodomy/) to overrule them shocked those who genuinely believed that sodomy
should be punished by law. The highest courts of several states found that their
constitutions forbid discrimination against same-sex couples in the granting of
marriage licenses, resulting in state constitutional amendments, the creation of
civil unions, and [Massachusetts's](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/04/politics/main597863.shtml)
now official recognition of gay marriages. Meanwhile a handful of mayors defied
state lawmakers by granting licenses to same-sex partners, unsurprisingly led by
San Francisco (gay-friendly Austin did not follow). And now in this election
year we have begun the [ultimate
debate](http://news.google.com/news?q=gay+marriage&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=nn)&mdash;whether the states should be allowed to recognize gay marriages
or the Constitution amended to forbid it.

I believe that society has a stake in promoting the equitable access of its individuals
to the resources of life, preferably through a market-based system with minimal
though carefully placed regulation of affairs. When regulation would not demean
the general welfare of the people rather than promote it, I attempt to maintain
consistency in opposing it. Though our capitalist, federated Republic has its flaws,
it functions well at its best and enshrines the rights of its members in a still-revolutionary
manner.

The membership of this federation is, of course, composed of two classes: individuals
and states. Within the Constitution and its amendments are laws affecting and regulating
the relationships between and amongst the two classes and the federal government
itself. Within this context decisions are meant to devolve to the local level wherever
feasible.

Thus it is that I am inclined to leave the question of gay marriage to the states,
who have already been recognized as the final secular authority in other matters
of wedlock. Sadly, the [Constitution](http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html), which strives to insure the tyranny of neither
the majority nor the minority, has a flaw in this regard:

> "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,
> Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State." [Article IV, Section
> 1]

Wherefore, a marriage recognized in one state must be given equal rights and responsibilities
in another state as that state grants to its own citizens. The tyranny of the minority
is at hand.

What can and should be done to reconcile such a conundrum? No longer a merely
theoretical discussion, may wish to bring rectification with what may be undue
haste. It is true that the states are immediately placed in an unjust position.
However, the short-term harm to the states is truly [negligible](http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/ny-bc-ny--gaymarriage-lawsu0712jul12,0,1847916.story?coll=ny-ap-regional-wire),
and would be a poor excuse for placing the greater emphasis on ratification than
debate. We must grant a measured time for public discourse before attempting to
legislate a resolution.

The issues before us are many and certainly call into question cherished
assumptions of al idealogies. Can one state be allowed to impose its own
morality on another? If not, should we then impose upon that state in denying
its right to self-legislation? Or should we strike the requirement of states to
recognize one another's licenses?

Going further, perhaps the legal rights of marriage itself must be refined.
Should a non-child rearing, non-working spouse be granted the same pension,
insurance, etc. as one removed from the workforce on behalf of the family? Some
would say that these fiscal considerations are at the heart of today's debate.

The methods of resolving this conflict are many. The 20th century religious
leader ['Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%60Abdu%27l-Bah%E1)
said that "[t]he shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of
differing opinions." Let us then enter into civil debate, that we may arrive at
the spark of truth with all deliberate speed.
