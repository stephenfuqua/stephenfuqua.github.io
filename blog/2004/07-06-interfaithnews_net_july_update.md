It has been several months since an InterfaithNews.Net update has been sent out, for which we apologize;
your intrepid editor is preparing to move to St. Paul, Minnesota (USA) next month.

As many in the audience already know, Barcelona, Spain will play host to the 2004
Parliament of the World's Religions beginning today (June 7). Please send in your
comments afterwards&mdash;essays, reviews, critiques, and praise&mdash;and we will
work to compile them for the benefit of those of us who cannot attend this year's
festivities.

As the last update was written in April, the site now contains news from My, June,
and this first week of July, as well as three new polls about the site's functioning.
So please stop by, enjoy, and vote.

### Three Survey Questions

We would like to think that INN has become a valuable resource for you&mdash;but
  we'd also like to see it become much more. We would love to see INN become a
  piece of the larger community-building across and amongst religious and spiritual
  groups the world over. To this end we've begun a series of community polls with
  these three questions: 1) Would it be useful to be able to leave comments after
  questions? 2) How often would you like to receive updates from INN? and 3) Would
  text ads to support new feature development be acceptable?
