I'm happy to say that there are still plenty of other Cure fans out there. They
debuted at #7 in the US and are still #23 on Billboard Hot 100 Albums. I heard
them on 101x yesterday (Austin alternative) and they're in the top 20 rotation
there. They were debuted at #1 in Mexico, oddly enough, and had good debuts
across Europe and in Argentina. But sadly they have not announced any new dates
for the Curiosa Festival with Interpol, Mogwai, and others, so I will have to
remain detached&hellip .

I must say that the first few times I heard The End of the World (new single) I
absolutely hated it. But it has grown on me, especially in context with the rest
of the album. It also helps that I've now heard it  properly&mbash;the first time was
live recorded from Letterman and the second was with not-so-hot reception on a
not-so-hot rental radio in Minnesota last month. It will be interesting to see
if they have a second single out, and if so what it will be. To stay with the
pop stuff, it would be Before Three. To be more adventurous, Lost would be a
cool single. I think it would play well on alt radio, which is usually the point
of a single, right? Not that I care that much about radio, you know.

Maybe if I give Cut Here (off of the Greatest Hits) another chance it will grow
on me too. Really not into that song. I was rather disturbed with this in my
mind when I first heard End of the World. Was quite worried that it would be an
entire album of shlock. Thankfully not so!
