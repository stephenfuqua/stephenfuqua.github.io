I had read about it, I had heard about it, and tonight I finally watched it: Jon
Stewart on CNN's _Crossfire_ (Courtesy of [ifilm.com](http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2652831)). I'm sure its
been all over the blogosphere and I'm probably the last blogger in the world to
notice it, but that's okay. I'm sure opinions range, but I probably rank in the
majority of bloggers in saying "right on, Jon."

Not having cable, I rarely have occasion to watch Jon Stewart. I did manage to
catch some of his election coverage in 2000 and was thoroughly impressed then
(as were the Peabody awards). I pay a good deal of attention to what is
happening in the world, with most of my news being filtered through NPR and the
New York Times, two media that I feel do a better job of stepping above the
partisan sniping and hacking (though the Times' editorialist, particularly Paul
Krugman and Maureen down, sometimes get a bit over the top for my tastes. If
they would present solutions like most of the other editorialists too, I would
have much more respect for them).

Why do I restrict myself to these sources? Well, Stewart pretty much summed it
up. I've tried watching some of the Sunday morning shows. I've watched guys come
on the Newshour with Jim Lehrer. I've watched CNN, though not recently. While I
usually respect the hosts, I find the guests to be blathering idiots who
regurgitate the same thing over and over. That's why I not only laughed, but
appreciated and respected Stewart's criticisms.

Tucker Carlson scored some valid points back at Stewart &mdash; that is, if you
are scoring from the Crossfire / Hardball / O'Reilly Factor camps. I've read the
criticism elsewhere too ([excellent
article in the Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/weekinreview/24cave.html)). I don't know if he's still a comedian in the
traditional sense. And I don't know that it matters. Perhaps he is the new court
jester... playing nice to the politicians when he has too, but then poking
holes in the system's stupidities when he has the opportunity. And what's so
wrong with treating guests like human beings periodically? I cannot see anything
wrong with asking John Kerry if the attacks get to him sometimes.

Anyway, I enjoyed the little debate, which surely is amongst the most original
and thought-provoking ever aired on Crossfire, and I highly recommend it to any
and all stopping through here.
