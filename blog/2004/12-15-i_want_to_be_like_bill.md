Updated 12/19._ This Friday (12/17/2004) will be the last
broadcast of [Now with Bill Moyers](https://www.pbs.org/now/) on PBS,
a fantastic show that takes journalism seriously and brings insightful &mdash;
and sometimes harrowing &mdash; news to its viewers. I have often found myself
unable to watch _Now_, knowing that what Moyers uncovers would only ruin my
weekend (by usually confirming already held fears or introducing new ones). But
like Moyers himself, I am an optimist in the end &mdash; I refuse to give in to
despair at the condition of the world. Do you remember those "I want to be like
Mike" Gatorade commercials with Michael Jordan? Well, I don't want to be like
Mike. **I want to be like Bill.**

<!-- truncate -->

First, let me step back from the demise of _Now_: Moyers is retiring from the
show he created, but it will be carried forward by David Brancaccio, whose
Marketplace broadcasts (on NPR) I had grown to enjoy. I'm confident that _Now_
will continue to be an insightful and influential source of in-depth and
original reporting, though it will be shortened by half an hour and sandwiched
between Tucker Carlson and some _Wall Street Journal_ guy. Now back to Moyers.

I've seen a number of articles in recent days by and about Moyers that are truly
inspirational and/or informative: [Battlefield Earth](https://www.alternet.org/2004/12/battlefield_earth) (by),
[PBS' Future
Post-Moyers](https://www.alternet.org/2004/12/pbs_future_post-moyers) (tangentially about), [Our Debt to
Bill Moyers](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/our-debt-bill-moyers/) (about), [Bill Moyers Leaves PBS in
the Middle of a Rebalancing Act](https://able2know.org/topic/39780-1) (tangential).

I want to draw particular attention to the _Battlefield Earth_ article, which is
actually the text of a talk given by Moyers upon receiving a Global Environment
Citizen Award. The main thrust of his speech is the relationship between the
religious right and continued refusal by the U.S. government to adequately deal
with environmental issues: **"millions of Christian fundamentalists may believe
that environmental destruction is not only to be disregarded but actually
welcomed &mdash; even hastened &mdash; as a sign of the coming apocalypse."**
For more exploration of the depth of the problem faced by the environmental
movement, see [The Godly Must Be
Crazy](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2004-10-26/godly-must-be-crazy/)
(author referenced by Moyers).

So add another ill-effect of the Left Behind series to my [post of
11/28/2004](./11-28-left_behind.md). This is precisely why _the religious
non-right_ needs to get together with each other and with the scientists if we
are to accomplish anything meaningful in the fight to create a sustainable
civilization_*, as I hinted at in [Reforming the Environmental Movement](./11-30-reforming_the_environmental_movement.md) (11/30/2004).

Finally, though there is much that one can find inspiring in Moyers' work over
the years, I leave you with the final paragraph from _Battlefield Earth_, the
proximate cause of "I want to be like Bill:"

> The news is not good these days. I can tell you, though, that as a journalist I
> know the news is never the end of the story. The news can be the truth that
> sets us free &mdash; not only to feel but to fight for the future we want. And
> the will to fight is the antidote to despair, the cure for cynicism, and the
> answer to those faces looking back at me from those photographs on my desk.
> What we need to match the science of human health is what the ancient
> Israelites called "hochma" &mdash; the science of the heart ... the capacity
> to see ... to feel ... and then to **act ... as if the future depended on
> you**. (_emphasis added_)

\* I say "non-right" because I don't believe it is helpful to cordon off
politically liberal and centrist religionists from conservative ones. One can be
a conservative Christian without being a part of the religious right, for
instance Jimmy Carter: politically left but personally conservative and
evangelical. I would prefer to say "non religious right" but that would sound
like non-religious instead of non-"religious right."

## Update 12/19/2004

The last episode of _Now_ was of course brilliant as usual. Yes, Bill Moyers
goes out on a limb and editorializes (that's why he's not a news anchor). But he
backs everything up with facts, something you won't find Bill O'Reilly doing.

Read a great article at the _Times_: [Moyers
Leaves a Public Affairs Pulpit With Sermons to Spare](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/17/arts/television/17moye.html), with a perfect summary
of his mission: "The gospel of Mr. Moyers &mdash; an unreconstructed progressive
&mdash; warns against the danger of media consolidation, the growing links
between conservative government and conservative media and the threat of
information control by government."

If you missed his last episode, the transcript (unhelpful link removed; SF 2025)
should be posted soon.
