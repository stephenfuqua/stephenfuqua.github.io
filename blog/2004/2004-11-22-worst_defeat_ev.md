Worst defeat ever (in soccer).

<!-- truncate -->

In order to exorcise the demon of wounded pride (and wounded knee, literally), I
will announce that my soccer team was completely outclassed by a younger,
faster, more talented team.

I could run circles around them, when I could breath. But I can't shoot. When
you're under 30 and the rest of your team is over 40, you become the forward due
to that very ability to run around the other team. (Which I seem to be able to
do even when the other team is younger than mine and/or in better shape). But it
doesn't matter what you do to get near the net if all you can do is make a lousy
kick when you get there.

At least I scored a goal. On a penalty kick. Our only goal of the game. Second
time I've had the only goal on an easy kick (the other time was not a penalty
though, just good passing and movement up to the net, where I took a crisp pass
and simply put it behind the goalie). Its been a breakout season for me in this
sense: 3 goals in 4 games. I normally have 3 goals in 4 years. But that still
doesn't help.

Not when you lose 18-1.

At least I got some good exercise. And now I feel better about it, thanks for
listening =). See, I'm not quite _always_ on about serious world issues!
