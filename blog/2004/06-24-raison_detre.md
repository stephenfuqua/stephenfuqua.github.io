So why the blog all the sudden? After hinting at it for years, I've finally
  decided to take the plunge. Rather than bore you with drawn out prose extolling
  the virtues of blogging and all that...

<!-- truncate -->

* I enjoy **writing and communicating**, and this is a good way of practicing.
* We **moving to St. Paul, Minnesota** in mid August, and this might be a
  helpful way of keeping up with various friends back here in Texas (and those
  who have spread out already).
* To **share thoughts**, on occasion, on topics I'm passionate about. i.e. the
  Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith, the interfaith movement, science,
  environmentalist, open source software, etc.
* Just to **challenge myself**, see if I can do really keep up for a little
  while .
* And to periodically entertain friends and family alike, or, rather, to share
  with them newly discovered ways of entertaining oneself on the web =). And in
  that spirit... ~Keep the Drunk From Falling~.
* I've been writing and editing for the web since 1995, and this site has been
  alive since 1998. But I've never had a consistent way of letting people know
  what's going on, what projects I'm working on (for the couple of people that
  might be interested), etc.
* Because Friendster is slow as molasses.

I hope this doesn't look like an ego fest, and more importantly, that it is
in actuality not. I'm not expecting to garner a fan-base of thousands; I'll
accept a small handful or even none. Its the writing, and the friends who stop
by and offer their own thoughts and comments, that matters to me. Now the immediate
danger is that I spend too much time on it! (That would be one reason I've held
off for so long).

So please enjoy, and expect a couple of updates per week on average.
