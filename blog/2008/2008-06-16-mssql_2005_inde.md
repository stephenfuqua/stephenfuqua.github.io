Good article on using indexed views: <a
href="http://www.novicksoftware.com/Articles/Indexed-Views-Basics-in-SQL-Server-Page-4.htm">Indexed
Views Basics in SQL Server</a>. Similar good coverage in Ben-Gan's _Inside
Microsoft SQL Server 2005: T-SQL Programming_. Problem: both specify that the
hint `WITH(NOEXPAND)` needs to be used when executing a query against the index
on anything other than Enterprise and Developer. However, I've found that it is
also required for Enterprise.
