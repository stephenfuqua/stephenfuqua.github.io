Manager-dom was not a sought-after status (though I admit to prior curiosity),
but as with many other engineers-turned-managers, it found me anyway (Q3 2023).
Being a team lead and then an architect came naturally and brought success for
many years. Some of the skills translate well from those roles while other
necessary capabilities tend to be underdeveloped. Nothing can truly substitute
for the value of gaining experience and reflecting on it; here are a few
resources that I have found useful in my journey so far, giving me new ideas to
play with and questions to aid my reflection.

Let's start with [What I wish somebody told me during my first year as a
manager](https://zaidesanton.substack.com/p/a-letter-to-the-first-time-manager),
which I only encountered yesterday. Most of its advice is not new, and yet
it is nevertheless timely. What I most appreciated was this acknowledgment:

> "You didn’t expect the emotional drain, right? That some days you’ll be so
> exhausted from being responsible for everything, that you’ll come home and
> just collapse on the couch." (Anton Zaides)

For me it wasn't so much a collapse on the couch as a recognition that it became
harder to get a second (third?) wind after dinner and on the weekend, at least
for creative endeavors or mentally challenging avocational work.

Here are two books that offer mutually-reinforcing advice, though in wildly
different writing styles:

* [First, Break All the
  Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First,_Break_All_the_Rules) was a
  recommendation from a veteran manager. The book has been influential enough
  that some of the rules-to-be-broken already seemed a little dated, because
  people in my orbit have already been breaking them. That does not diminish its
  value in bringing deeply researched topics to light. This was a very worthy
  physical book purchase - a tome that I am sure to revisit periodically for
  years to come.
* [Managing Humans](https://managinghumans.com/) is a series of
  frequently-humorous essays by [Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com/),
  which I found in my [O'Reilly
  subscription](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-humans-more/9781484271162/).
  One of my highlights that I need to continue practicing in 2025:

  > "Every month, your team produced something and it's your job to document
  > that production. I do this by spending an hour a month jotting down
  > reflections of the team for the past 30 days. What stands out in my mind?
  > What'd we do? Who rocked?" (Michael Lopp).

Both books have topics addressing the root causes of the _emotional drain_.
Sometimes you can't avoid the drain, which probably means having a difficult
conversation. [Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are
High](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucial_Conversations:_Tools_for_Talking_When_Stakes_Are_High)
will help you move past the fight-or-flight tendency into a productive
interaction.

Finally, at some point I skimmed through [_Management 3.0: Leading Agile
Developers, Developing Agile
Leaders_](https://management30.com/books/management30/), a book I had first read
ten years ago (cf in this blog: [easy : simple :: lazy :
efficient](../2014/05-17-easy-simple-lazy-efficient.md) and [Management
3.0: Knowledge and
Diversity](../2015/01-20-management_30_knowledge_and_diversity.md)). A
useful resource, but, unfortunately, what currently stands out in this reader's
mind is the author's off-putting sarcasm.
