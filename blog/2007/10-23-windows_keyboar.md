I've always been a  fan of keyboard shortcuts, using them whenever possible.
Today I accidentally pressed the Windows key and D at the same time &mdash; and
suddenly found that my whole desktop was revealed. How did I not know about
this? A quick search led me to a [great
page](https://pc.net/resources/windows_xp_shortcuts) with another 8-10 shortcuts
I didn't previously know. Now you too can be enlightened about the many uses of
the Windows key.
