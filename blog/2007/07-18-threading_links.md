I don't often have cause to use threading. In fact, I've found that it sometimes
gums up the works (perhaps because I don't understand it well enough?) &mdash;
slows things down. But when I do want to do some threading in C#, here are a few
pages I find helpful in reminding myself how to perform various functions:

* [Multi-threading in .NET: Introduction and suggestions](https://jonskeet.uk/csharp/threads/)
* [Threading in C# - Free E-book](https://www.albahari.com/threading/)
* MSDN's [Threading Tutorial](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645740(vs.71).aspx)
