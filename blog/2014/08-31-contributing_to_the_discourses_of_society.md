The Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s of Irving are trying out a concept: on the last Friday
of each month, we'll talk about a theme related to the "discourses of society,"
motivated by passages such as this one, from the Universal House of Justice's
2010 Ridv&aacute;n Letter to the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;­s of the world (p10):

> "... involvement in public discourse can range from an act as simple as
> introducing Bah&aacute;'&iacute; ideas into everyday conversation to more
> formal activities such as the preparation of articles and attendance at
> gatherings, dedicated to themes of social concern - climate change and the
> environment, governance and human rights, to mention a few. It entails, as
> well, meaningful interactions with civic groups and local organizations in
> villages and neighbourhoods."

The August event was the first in the series, and the concept itself was the
subject of the evening's presentation...
