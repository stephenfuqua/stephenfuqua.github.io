**Stirring up a grassroots movement is hard work.**

Dallas Interfaith Power &amp;
Light's steering committee has been working together for about two years
now. We've held a number of workshops and dialogues on diverse topics,
including: forming a green team, energy efficiency, solar, health impacts of
climate change, the value of our park systems, the science of climate change,
and more. Perhaps 100-150 people have attended, although our actual signed-in
attendance count is 84 across all events.

We have a Facebook page and a website, both of which have attracted a very small
audience. We've supported others' efforts, in small ways, to encourage shark
conservation, the new plastic bag ordinance in Dallas, and coal-free
electricity. We do not know what kind of impact we've had on those with whom
we've had some contact. No one feels satisfied that we are doing all that we can
to address the overwhelming challenges of climate change.

As organizers, we must ask ourselves: how do we push through our mental and
physical barriers, set aside our gnashing of teeth, and move forward into
focused action? With more questions, naturally.

The purpose of Dallas Interfaith Power & Light is to promote love, justice, and
care for creation through local action, education, and dialogue about climate
stewardship. That is a nice rallying cry. Now what is our specific vision? How
do we measure success? How do we reach a broader audience for that "action,
education, and dialogue?"

This summer, the group's steering committee will engage in a series of
conversations with diverse individuals and groups. This is all about building
relationships. The initial agenda is the conversation* itself. Are you
interested in a religious response to climate change? What are your practical
concerns? How can we help each other?

Listening to the responses can help us refine our vision and agenda. And yet, we
need a common sense of vision before a meaningful dialogue can take place. What
is Dallas IPL's goal â€“ what contributions do we expect to make in Dallas?
Developing a common vision, one that transcends our individual goals and is
easily communicable, is a second concern for the steering committee over the
coming months.

From the welter of the listening and envisioning processes, we hope to foster
the emergence of concrete goals and action plans. We will either emerge better
focused, or we will recognize that our paths are too divergent to make this
effort a success.

* Appropriate Freudian slip - initially I wrote "conservation" instead of
  "conversation" ;-)
