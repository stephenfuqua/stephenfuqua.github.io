Thanks to recent mowing, I was able to access the west-side of the pond at Sam
Houston Trail Park in Irving, TX this morning. The pond is drying up &mdash;
creating a wonderful concentration of aquatic creatures for the the shorebirds
to eat. These photos are as good as I can do. Positively identified:

* American Avocet
* Snowy Egret
* Least Sandpiper
* Stilt Sandpiper (pretty sure, not absolutely sure)
* Greater Yellowlegs
* Northern Shoveler
* Killdeer

I encountered a few more common birds, and just as I was leaving ran into a
group of three Lark Sparrows to cap off the muddy morning.
