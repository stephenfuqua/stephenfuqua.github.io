In the east, you have the [Ruby-Throated
Hummingbird](https://birds.audubon.org/birds/ruby-throated-hummingbird). In the west, there's the [Black-Chinned
Hummingbird](https://birds.audubon.org/birds/black-chinned-hummingbird). As with many other east/west divisions in both the animal and
plant kingdoms, the two hummers sometimes overlap right here in Dallas county
&mdash; for example, you can find both of them at [Dogwood Canyon Audubon Center at Cedar
Hill](https://dogwoodcanyon.audubon.org/). Living in northwestern Dallas County, we did not know which to expect
when we set out our feeder a few weeks ago. Thus far, it is has been entirely
Black-Chinned.

It started with a lone male. We saw his purple/black gorget in the sun,
and that was all we needed to identify him. There have been at least 2 adult
males zipping around. Yesterday, the females showed up. Two of them. Our first
sight of a female was followed by witness of an over-excited male, who went into
his wide J-shaped display dive. She wasn't interested. But the fact that he was
showing off for her was our first clue that we were still seeing Black-Chinned.

Next we got the binoculars and looked at a few signs. My other half managed to
get a couple of decent photographs through the patio window.  The montage above
helps illustrate some of the field marks for distinguishing the two:

* In the main photo, the crown is ever-so slightly grayer than the nape. In
  Ruby-Throated females the crowns are green.
* A psychedelic edge-effect filter helps show the shape of the wing. I've
  superimposed some black lines to give a suggestion of the difference in
  Ruby-Throated wings (at least according to [David Allen
  Sibley](https://www.sibleyguides.com)): Black-Chinned have wider, club-shaped
  wings and Ruby-Throated have narrower wings with more of an edged tip.
* The second photo has a good look at the bill, which tends to be longer and
  somewhat curved in Black-Chinned. Some Ruby-Throated will also have a bit of
  de-curvature, so this is  not a perfect diagnostic.

Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds also have longer tails, relative to the wings. The
photos do not show this because of the perspective, but I tried to give that
sense with the crude drawing. Another sign, not illustrated here (and not
strongly seen in today's birds) is that Black-Chinned tend to pump their tails
significantly more frequently.
