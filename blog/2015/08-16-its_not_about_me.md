More than twenty years ago, the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Bah&aacute;&iacute;s of the United States [published
a statement](https://www.ibiblio.org/Bahai/Texts/English/The-Vision-Of-Race-Unity.html) declaring that "[r]acism is the most challenging issue
confronting America" (_The Vision of Race Unity_). This past year has reinforced
the public awareness of this truth: 59% of the nation's population believes that
"our country needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with
whites", compared to only 46% about a year ago ([Pew
Research Center](https://www.people-press.org/2015/08/05/across-racial-lines-more-say-nation-needs-to-make-changes-to-achieve-racial-equality/)). I grieve to wonder how many of the remaining 41% recognize
the systemic challenges faced by African Americans, and either don't care or,
worse yet, are satisfied with them.

As a white, multi-generational American, I have benefited tremendously from
centuries of this systemic and institutional racism. And it feels as if there is
little I can do to remedy the continuing injustice. I try to play my part
through acting on the threat of climate change &mdash; which is
disproportionately impacting those already at a disadvantage relative to me [*](#1).

Over the past year, I have kept my mouth shut, and eyes open. There are too few
African Americans in my social circles, so most everything I hear is filtered
through news and social media. The Guardian seems to have done a good job of
covering the issues from the standpoint of freedom and equality[**](#2). From these sources do I learn my limited insights on the
meaning of #BlackLivesMatter.

One of those important insights is this: it is not about me. Saying that "all
lives matter," for example,  would sound like a nice platitude for reaching out
to everyone (why are Latinos excluded?). But in truth, it comes across as an
attempt to wrest control of the narrative back to include me (white male). And
it is thus a slap in the face to the urgent necessity of recognizing that black
lives are not, in fact, treated equally with white lives in America.

It isn't about me. I should sit back and listen. Read. Learn. Think deeply about
how to handle those moments when my actions and words might make me _part_ of
the problem &mdash; or, hopefully, part of the solution. And then, set ego aside
and act in service.

Writing this feels mildly inconsistent, as if I were turning the conversation
back on myself after all. Nevertheless, self-reflection is critical if I am to
"lend effective support to the resolution of a problem that hinders the advance
of this great republic toward the full realization of its glorious destiny"
(from the _Vision of Race Unity_).
