The Elm Fork of the Trinity River has returned to its secondary banks at last
and the Sam Houston Trail Park on the Campi&oacute;n Trail is once again
accessible, after two months of flooding. Riding my bike there today, I managed
to get a few good photos, which are posted on [Google
Photos](https://plus.google.com/photos/110829098089228358837/albums/6064182910237070737). First six in the gallery are from last fall, but the rest are from
today.
