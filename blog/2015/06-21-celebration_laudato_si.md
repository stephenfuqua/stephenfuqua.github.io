I've spent the weekend preparing a presentation on the [Call to Action on
Climate Change](./06-28-faithful_call_to_actonclimate_change_-_recap.md), which
I'll be giving at the [Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Center of
Irving](https://www.irvingbahai.org) on this coming Friday evening.

Joining so many others in the worldwide faith communities, I am overjoyed at the
Pope's encyclical [_Laudato
Si_](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html), which came out officially just a few days ago. Although I will not be
saying much about it, it is a large part of the inspiration for the up-coming
presentation. And I would like to share the heart-achingly beautiful second
paragraph:

> This sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her
> by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed
> her. We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to
> plunder her at will. The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is
> also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water,
> in the air and in all forms of life. This is why the earth herself, burdened
> and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor; she
> "groans in travail" (Rom 8:22). We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust
> of the earth (cf. Gen 2:7); our very bodies are made up of her elements, we
> breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters.
