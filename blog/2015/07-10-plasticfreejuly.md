A social media challenge was posed, [#PlasticFreeJuly](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PlasticFreeJuly&src=typd):
try to avoid plastic in the month of July. Taken literally, many of us would be
unable to read the challenge, without the plastic of our corrective lenses.
Perhaps someone, somewhere, still makes glasses from melted, ground, sand. I
shudder to think of the weight required to correct my own poor vision this way.

But there is a deeper truth: the gauntlet was delivered through a medium whose
human-tangible representation beamed out through melted sand, encased in
plastic, with circuits embedded in plastic. Perhaps someone, somewhere,
manufactures computers using naught but metals, sand, and rubber insulation.
With vacuum tubes.

This is not to excoriate the notion of going 100% plastic-free. Rather, these
lessons constrain the month-long experiment to the realm of consumables. Let us
come back to the more durable goods when we are ready to overthrow an entire way
of life. Which may be necessary sooner than later.

## But why?

As will be seen in future posts, going plastic-free, in the United States at least, is an exceedingly difficult undertaking. Why bother?

### Non-human Impact

For one thing, plastics are [killing
off life](http://education.nationalgeographic.com/encyclopedia/great-pacific-garbage-patch) in large swathes of the Pacific ocean. One day this may have a
ripple effect directly impinging on human welfare. But for this writer, life is
intrinsically meaningful &mdash; it is worth preserving for its own sake.

Even were this not the case, it is through studying the great diversity of life
that humanity uncovers the hidden realities from which these diversities emerge.
Life reveals itself. This is revelation. The quest to understand the universe is
one of the great endeavors of humanity. As we destroy life, so too do we lose,
perhaps forever, the information encoded in that which is gone. It is as if we
were ripping pages blindly from the book of life.

### Community Impact

On a personal level, most of the consumable plastic that comes through my
household exits in blue bags destined for the city's recycling center. But not
all can be treated this way, and unlike glass or aluminum, recycled plastic
cannot be used indefinitely. Overall, the vast majority of our plastic still
ends up in landfills. The [EPA claims](http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/plastics.htm)
that "plastics make up almost 13 percent of the municipal solid waste stream"
(though I am troubled by the lack of a citation).

There are all kinds of environmental justice issues related to landfills, which
are frequently sited in minority communities. Landfills take up real estate that
could be put to better use, and various toxic chemicals can leach out of the
plastics

### Personal Impact

Plastics as they are produced and delivered to consumers can have deleterious
health effects, both on the consumers and any creatures downstream from plastic
waste. The famous BPA was just one case in point. Although widely debated, as
with climate change, most studies that are not funded by the plastics industry
seem to point to significant health impacts from BPA. And researchers are
finding more-and-more plastics that can impact personal health through
hormone-like behavior.

### Risk and Reward

Admittedly, there have been clear rewards from the use of plastic: they are cheap (thanks to an inadequate system of taxation
on natural resources); they are lightweight (lowering transportation emissions
compared to glass); they are effective at containing and protecting all manner
of products (plastic bottles don't shatter when you drop them).

But the risks, and real harms, are also clear once we begin to investigate them
seriously. They are harming life in general, irrespective of human utility; life
in specific utility to human beings; and life in the ultimate subjectivity of
the self.

Even as the controversies remain, if there are good alternatives, why not pursue them?

## Postscript

After writing this, I was looking at some of the #PlasticFreeJuly tweets and
realized that, for many of these tweeters, the scope is actually quite narrow
(but nevertheless useful): eliminate _single-use_ plastics during the month of
July. But I reacted to the one tweet that had come through my feed, which only
had the challenge "eliminate plastic." Even single-use is challenging: this
morning I threw away a small plastic inner cap from a milk carton.
