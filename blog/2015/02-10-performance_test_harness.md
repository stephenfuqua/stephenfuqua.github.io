A lightweight performance test harness for Windows console apps: [PerfTestHarness
on GitHub](https://github.com/stephenfuqua/PerfTestHarness/tree/master). Includes some fun use of [C# 6](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn802602.aspx) property
initializers, string interpolation, `nameof()`, and expression bodied functions.
