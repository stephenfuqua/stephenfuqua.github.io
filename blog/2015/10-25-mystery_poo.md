Who did this? Who would leave such mighty poo below my bell pepper? Our fence is too tight for rabbits...

It is a tobacco hornworm!

And another!

Three there were on Wednesday\
(That could be seen, anyway),\
Leaving a mighty mess.\
Three were joined by five today,\
Eating tomatoes in excess.\
Bell peppers they devoured,\
Undaunted by the showers\
Of the record rains.\
Were it spring,\
I would complain,\
And hold them all at bay.\
But here in fall,\
I do not mind &mdash;\
Let them eat away!\
