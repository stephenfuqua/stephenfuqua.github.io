Citizen-science: meet open source software. I'm starting an open source project
called FlightNode, which will be a platform for citizen science bird
conservation monitoring projects.

This project builds off the [IbaMonitoring.org](http://www.ibamonitoring.org)
project I took on in 2010. I've been approached by a conservation organization
here in Texas, asking for my help to build something similar to that site, but
tailored for their purpose (I need to get their permission before using their
name). What they want and need is more than I can provide in my "spare time."
And I know of other programs that would be interested in using components of
these projects.

Building an open source platform to support conservation efforts has been a
dream of mine for several years - but I need help! I will build out the
requirements and more information about the project and architecture (fyi, using
ASP.NET WebAPI and Angular.js), and I expect to write much of the code. Do you
think you might be interested in contributing? Even if it is only to develop one
feature, your help would be fantastic. And it would be a great opportunity to
get more experience in API development and/or Angular.js.

Code will be posted at
[https://github.com/FlightNode](https://github.com/FlightNode). Let me know if
you're interested, and I'll invite you to join the FlightNode organization on
GitHub.
