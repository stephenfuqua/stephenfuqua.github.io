The [National Preach-In on Global Warming](http://www.preachin.org/)
is coming up - Feb 8 - 10 &mdash; and I am excited to say that the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s of Grand Prairie have signed on! This event is a project
of <a href="http://www.interfaithpowerandlight.org">Interfaith Power &amp;
Light</a>; its purpose is to "help clergy bring attention to this key moral
issue [global climate change] of our time". We may not have clergy in the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith, but that need not stop our Spiritual Assemblies from
participating.

The Bah&aacute;'&iacute; calendar, with 19 months and 19 days (plus 4-5
intercalary days), is punctuated by a Feast at the beginning of every month -
more spiritual than physical. The Feast is composed of three parts - devotions,
consultation, and fellowship. The month of "Dominion" (Mulk) begins on the 7th
of February, but the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s of Grand Prairie are holding our
Feast on Friday the 8th.

The devotions will explore the relationships of God, humanity, and nature,
including the creation care implied by the term "dominion" in the book of
Genesis. Devotions and consultation will be bridged by a brief presentation of
the formal position of the international Baha'i community, which is that climate
change is occurring and "it is critical that the world act in a unified way to
prevent future climate change and to help humanity to adapt to the changes
already set in motion."

During the consultation, the community will be asked to consider sending the
"Love Creation" [postcards
to the President](https://www.preachin.org/sermon-ideas/send-postcards-to-president-obama/). As well, we will broach the topic of next steps for our
community.
