:::

Like many, when I first encountered the term "agile software development," I
thought it was an excuse for a cowboy culture: low planning, low documentation,
run as fast as you can and assume that each person's brilliance will  take care
of everything. Since it came up in the context of a very large client asking us
about our methodology ("what's a software development methodology?" I asked
myself), I thought I should dig into a little more. [_Integrating Agile
Development in the Real
World_](https://books.google.com/books/about/Integrating_Agile_Development_In_The_Rea.html?id=9J_0ly01QicC),
by Peter Schuh, quickly showed me it is not that simple. Agile development is,
in fact, all about fostering a systematic, right-sized, just-in-time development
process. For me, being "agile" means embracing change instead of being locked
into preconceived notions (requirements). But don't throw everything out the
window either.

How do we become agile? Read the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/),
then scroll down and find the Agile Principles. Work on internalizing them,
especially that part where the Manifesto acknowledges value in processes, tools,
documentation, etc.: "while there is value in the items on the right, we value
the items on the left more." That's a start on the mindset. Now what about
practice?

Review the various [Agile
methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Methods),
and consider adopting one of them ([Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) being the
most well known as of 2024). There are many mature frameworks with a great deal
of experience behind them. If possible, adopt one _by the book_: don't try to
adapt or alter until you've mastered the practice ([Shu Ha
Ri](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html)). If it is "not possible," then
adopt what you can and work on breaking down the barriers, in _close
collaboration_ with stakeholders and management (you won't be able to go it
alone, from the trenches).

To repeat: master the practice(s). That is, _practice at_: writing stories;
designing ahead just enough to reach a useful inflection point; adopting a
rhythm for development, inspection, and adaptation; and whatever else your
chosen methodology suggests. Continue emphasizing engineering excellence and
emphasizing the importance of learning what will delight your customers. Most of
all, be flexible &mdash; eventually, even with the methodology itself. Be Agile.
