Sometimes you need to go back to the basics - including basic technology. In
this case, I mean sticky notes. Yes, they are a remarkable form of _technology_.
I like doing everything the digital way. I abhor using paper when not necessary,
because of the waste factor. Although I love the idea of note cards for user
story development, I've been thankful that they are impractical for my
development team. But, I think it is time to heed good advice.

For several months now I've been running bi-weekly retrospectives. Following
good advice found many places (initially in _Integrating Agile Development in
the Real World_), the retrospectives focus on:

* listing&hellip;
  * things that are going well,
  * things that are not going well,
  * and opportunities for improvement;
* having a brief discussion on solutions for the 2nd and 3rd bullets;
* prioritizing the list; and
* assigning takeaways.

Chapter 19 of _Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Team_
refers to the listing practice in more simple terms: start, stop, and continue.
And they provide this advice&hellip;

> All team members write "start," "stop," and "continue" items on sticky notes,
> and then during the retrospective meeting they put the stickies on the board
> and group them by topic. &hellip; It can be  hard to remember the past two
> weeks, much less an entire release, if that's what your retrospective covers.
> Research different creative approaches to reflecting on your team's
> experiences.

How obvious and true! So let's hand out some color coded‡, blank, sticky notes
in advance, just a small stack to everyone on the team (‡ pink = stop, yellow/or
other = continue, green = start). Ask them to fill out as things occur to them.
When it comes time for the retrospective, bring all that still seem relevant.
Better yet, put them on a piece of paper, slap that paper down on the
copier/scanner, and create a digital version. We can quickly chop up the digital
versions, arrange them in any one of various Office/type products, and have a
nice (and easy) picture instead of boring meeting notes.

It is my hope that this process will:

* make it easier to remember start/stop/continue items in space in between
  meetings,
* and re-emphasize  the importance of this collective feedback process.

This is nothing breathtaking or revolutionary on my part. If it works, it just
means I needed to relax and rely on technology to help fix a problem &mdash; the
simplest technology possible. Sticky notes. If it doesn't work out, hopefully
someone will be kind of enough to write that down on a pink note and bring it to
a future retrospective.
