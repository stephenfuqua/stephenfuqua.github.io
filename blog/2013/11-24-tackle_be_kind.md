This is a technical blog, right? Why would I mention this virtue? In [Management
3.0](https://jurgenappelo.com/pages/management30), Jurgen Appelo suggests in
"Do-It-Yourself Team Values" that the various Agile, Lean, XP, etc. principles
are, quite simply, _virtues_. Teams should pick a small number and focus on
them. "Kindness" is not among the 50 virtues he suggests thinking about, but it
should not come as a surprise that that my rationale for "kindness" will overlap
that of many other virtues, such as "helpfulness," "mindfulness," "tactfulness,"
and "service." Each of these single words offers a slightly different window
into an ineffable world of human goodness, and I choose "kindness" for this
theory. First, a minor digression.

Information technology (IT) is about business, which is capitalism. Some would
have us believe that capitalism is about ruthlessly applying all available
resources in the pursuit of ever-expanding wealth for the shareholders. Bill
Gates has done a lot of good in recent years, but with wealth accrued from
frequently ruthless business tactics. Where is there room for kindness in the
business environment? This is not the place for a thorough discussion of
political economy, so I will offer little justification for this postulate:
capitalism and **virtue are not incompatible**. Maybe I'll follow-up on this on
my [regular blog](../) one day. For now, I'll stick to the small-scale:
programmers in a (primarily) business environment.

This notion of kindness stems from a remark from a co-worker a few years ago. He
asked how I managed to "deal with" a particular business representative, with
whom many others would become frustrated and flustered. My response: I _work
with her_, not _deal with her_. I tried to understand her position, negotiate in
good faith, and act out of patience and compassion.

What does it mean? [Etymology
Online](https://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=kind) suggests the original
meaning was something like treating people like family. Let's focus on the ideal
of family treatment, not the dysfunction, shall we? Why be kind? That whole
Golden Rule thing, for one. To whom should programmers be kind? Users,
stakeholders, each other, themselves.

* **USERS**: a successful application tries to help the user, actively thinking
  about his/her tasks and the context for those tasks. Is the individual use the
  application constantly? Then place even more emphasis than usual on easy
  screen navigation, without the need of repetitive wrist movements. Use clear
  and easy-to-understand terminology, on screen and in error messages. Learn the
  language of your users, so that these messages are meaningful to them, rather
  than being cryptic programmer-speak.
* **STAKEHOLDERS**: provide meaningful insight into project status, so that they
  can react to delays, innovations, questions. They can't do their jobs without
  those insights. And if they can't do their jobs, then your software project is
  unlikely to be successful.
* **EACH OTHER**: provide documentation; write clean, [coherent
  code](./07-26-tackle_be_coherent.md); support and encourage each other.
* **YOURSELF**: think of your future self. Don't take shortcuts or be lazy, as
  it will come back to haunt you at 2:00 AM when production is down. Go ahead
  and write a few more tests to bring that test coverage up to 90% or more, even
  if no one else is looking. Your future self will thank you for it.

I never realized how hard it would be to write up a justification for this
suggestion. Consider this a first attempt, and hopefully I'll be able to come
back to it over time for a more cogent argument.

Some people's natures might not allow them to be so pro-actively positive as
this blog post suggests, but I rather like  [The Positive
Programmer](https://www.rdegges.com/the-positive-programmer/). The paragraph on
compassion is closely related to the kindness I am speaking of above.
