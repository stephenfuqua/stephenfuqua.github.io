Urban gardening and agriculture in public spaces are becoming accepted as potent
means for personal transformation, small-scale economic activity, and for
larger-scale climate mitigation and adaptation. This week, Dallas Interfaith
Power &amp; Light will be touring the East Dallas [Promise of
Peace](https://promiseofpeace.us/) community garden at [White Rock United
Methodist Church](https://www.wrumc.org/) &mdash; built, of all places, on top
of an unused parking lot! Based on the early feedback, we expect this will be
the first of many opportunities to tour community gardens in the ambit of sacred
spaces. Likewise, this will be the first of several blog posts on the subject.

## What is urban agriculture?

"Urban agriculture" is simply the act of bringing agriculture &mdash; the active
development of food resources &mdash; into the city. It is highly scalable, and
can take the shape of school yard plots, community gardens in vacant lots, small
scale farms on reclaimed land, greenhouses on strong building roofs, or at its
simplest, a patio of herbs and vegetables.  Naturally,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_agriculture) can tell you all
about it. Another  great resource for learning about this subject is the
[Resource Centres on Urban Agriculture and Food Security](https://www.ruaf.org),
an internationally-funded organization that works on issues of government policy
and civic society capacity-building.

## Where are they found?

In addition to [Promise of Peace](https://promiseofpeace.us), there are many
community gardens throughout the DFW area, including at numerous churches and
temples. The Gardeners in Community Development Group tries to maintain a
[comprehensive list](https://www.gardendallas.org/Area%20Gardens2.htm) of such
gardens.

Some of the many inspiring examples of urban agriculture elsewhere in North
America include:

* [Beacon Food Forest](https://www.beaconfoodforest.org/), currently under
  development in Seattle. "A Food Forest is a gardening technique or land
  management system that mimics a woodland ecosystem but substitutes in edible
  trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals."
* [Lufa Farms](https://lufa.com/en/farms), the rooftop greenhouse in Montreal.
  [Read about David Suzuki's
  tour](https://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/the-nature-of-things).
* [Growing Home](https://growinghomeinc.org/), a network of farms in the city of
  Chicago. "Growing Home changes lives and communities with organic agriculture
  &mdash; through job training, social enterprise, and community development."
* [For backyard-farmer companies, business is
  bountiful](https://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/02/business/la-fi-farmers-for-hire-20100502).
  Interested in fresh food from your backyard, but don't have the time or skill
  to work the land yourself? Innovative companies are popping up that will send
  their farmers to manage the land for you.
* [Promoting Urban Agriculture in Mexico City - Sembradores
  Urbanos](https://cityfarmer.info/promoting-urban-agriculture-in-mexico-city-sembradores-urbanos/)
  is another example of concrete gardening.

## Follow-up

I plan to follow-up this short article with additional posts addressing these
questions:

1. What does it have to do with climate change?
1. Why mix gardening/agriculture and religion?
1. What resources are available to help individuals and groups get started?
