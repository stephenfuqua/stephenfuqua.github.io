In a letter dated 2 March 2013, to the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s of Iran, the
Universal House of Justice wrote:

> "&hellip; the principle of the oneness of humankind, as proclaimed by

> nations. It calls for a complete reconceptualization of the relationships that

This of course begs the question, what should humanity's relationship with
nature be? We explored this to some extent in the devotions for the Feast of
Dominion in February. Now we ask you to continue that exploration here, with the
Feast of Glory, by considering how the Glory of God is revealed through, and yet
extends far beyond, Nature, which is also called Creation and Existence, and how
our relationship to this Creation must be one of humility and moderation.

In light of the House of Justice's statement above, and the passages below, what
are the implications of biological destruction and impoverishment of the
environment? On the one hand, we talk about the impact on human physical
well-being - but on another level, can we not also see that our spiritual
well-being is affected by the "deepening environmental crisis?" That each
creature that goes extinct, that each ecosystem that disappears through human
action, is a lost opportunity to praise and glorify God? Furthermore, the root
cause of this crisis is suggested to be an immoderate materialism, implying that
we must each and all avoid this "insatiable thirst for more." Finally, we see
that all of creation is inter-connected, and we should recognize and act out of
respect for this inter-connection, which is an expression of God's will.
