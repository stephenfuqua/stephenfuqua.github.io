Winter was once a midly depressing time for me, as it is for most: short, cool
days, brown grass, bear branches. Obviously this is Texas not Minnesota,
otherwise: shorter, super-cold days, car stuck in snow or sliding on ice (but
the grass was still green - under the snow - and the branches  would often have
a delicate coating of the white stuff). Fractals and birds started changing me
some years ago. This winter has only confirmed that.

I recall walking back to my dorm in the mid 90's and looking up at a large tree
in winter. Perhaps a flock of Great-tailed Grackles drew my eye. For the first
time, I looked deeply at the trunk, branches, twigs and stems, noticing the
beautiful, natural, fractal pattern. I stopped and just admired the creature,
and the underlying mathematics of nature (this was probably when I was taking
intro physics and mid-level calculus; I was also starting to overlay [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector#Physics) on
objects in motion and slightly in love with [Gaussian integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral),
that shows the deep relationship of exponentials to conics). From then on, I saw
winter as a time to appreciate the structural beauty of my surroundings, without
the distraction of bright colors and extraneous fluff.

Several years of assisting Dr. Homayoun in [her fieldwork](https://www.ibamonitoring.org/) have
turned me into an avid birder. When we were in Minnesota, winter meant no more
birding for us. Being back in Texas, it is now an altogether different story:
winter means the northern birds have come to us for a few months. Spring means
more birds come through on their migration northward, but it also means pesky
leaves that obscure your view. Spring is  beautiful, I love the heat of summer
followed by the crisp feeling of autumn (when we have one - a drawback of
Texas), but winter now stands shoulder-to-shoulder  with the others in my heart.

So its not a bird, but this coyote on Boxing Day excited me.

Finally, a word about organized birding: this year's [Christmas
Bird Count](https://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/home-and-gardening/headlines/20121226-tweet-this-its-time-for-audubons-annual-bird-count-in-dallas.ece?ssimg=835004) (_Dallas Morning News_), the first in Cedar Hill in many years,
was a tremendous success.   Personally, I saw 58 different species in one day
(New Year's), in parts of Grand Prairie, Cedar Hill, and Desoto. All told, the
volunteer group, based out of [Dogwood
Canyon Audubon Center](http://dogwoodcanyon.audubon.org), saw more than 100 species in the area, including
several surprising Bald Eagle sightings. Joining up with some experienced
birders is the best way to learn; for those in the Dallas area, the Trinity Bird Count (dead link) is a great way to
meet folks on organized birding trips in the city (currently all within Dallas).
Ignore the old dates - the calendar itself is up-to-date.

This little Field Sparrow, at the Cedar Hill Rec Center, was particularly photogenic after
a small speaker was hung in a tree, playing their chirps.
