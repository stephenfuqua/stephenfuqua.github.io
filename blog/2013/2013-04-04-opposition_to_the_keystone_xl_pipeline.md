In [December
2011](http://www.safnet.com/archives/2011/12/keystone-pipeline-nimby.html), I wondered if the opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline project was
truly just, given that Americans do not have the same kind of reaction to
_actual_ oil spills in places like Brazil and Nigeria, as to the _potential_ for
spills in the United States. Since then, I have learned more about the [climate
impact of tar sands](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/01/state-department-keystone-xl-likely-to-have-small-impact-on-climate-tar-sands/) (which admittedly is still not entirely clear),and
given more consideration to the justice and ethics. Thus while I still hold to
the main points of my previous blog post &mdash; we need to focus on reducing
energy consumption, and Americans should be equally concerned about ecological
impacts of oil production / transport outside the United States &mdash; I am now
firmly opposed to the construction of this pipeline, and have signed onto <a
href="http://www.interfaithpowerandlight.org">Interfaith Power &amp; Light's [letter-writing
campaign against the pipeline](http://action.interfaithpowerandlight.org/siteapps/advocacy/ActionItem.aspx?c=dmJUKgOZJiI8G&b=8627517&aid=519509).

(A) Previous thought: the alternative to piping through the US is piping through
Canada or trucking, so the NIMBY principle would just push the transport into
Canada. Well, [that
doesn't look so clear](http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ddroitsch/just_the_facts_climate_impacts_1.html), as there is considerable opposition to a pipeline in
Canada. It is being reported that other forms of transport are looking less
viable, so it appears to be the case that the Keystone XL Pipeline is the key to
unlocking, or bottling up, Canadian tar sands oil production.

(B) The cost of a spill in the middle of the nation would be huge, though just
what that really means is debatable. [Last
week's spill in Arkansas](http://www.alternet.org/environment/6-things-you-need-know-about-arkansas-oil-spill) helps drive that home. Previously I argued that we
should accept that risk if we're willing to accept it elsewhere. Now I prefer to
say we simply must not accept such a high risk, where risk = probability times
cost &rarr; low prob of spill times very high cost equals high risk.

(C) There is the principle of not being party to evil. Just because "its going
to happen anyway" (development of the tar sands oil) does not mean we, as a
country, should passively condone and profit it from it. In fact, ethically it
should mean just the opposite - we must refuse to profit from tar sands oil.

Now, having said all that, it is still absolutely clear that the only_ just_
response is for us all take a look in the mirror and ask ourselves how we're
going to reduce our own use of fossil fuels.
