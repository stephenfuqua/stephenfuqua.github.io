Today we are celebrating the second of the Twin Holy days in the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;
calendar: the birth of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h, founder of the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith, in 1817.
Yesterday we celebrated the birth of the B&aacute;b, born in 1819, who as an
independent messenger from God both declared a new religion as a break from
Islam, and prophesied that another, greater revelation would come soon after
His own. Both were born in Persia, which is today known as Iran. In the lunar
calendar used by the Muslim world, their births fell on consecutive days.
Consequently, Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s around the world celebrate them as the "Twin Holy Days".
