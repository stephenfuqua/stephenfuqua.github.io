What books leave you feeling misanthropic? And what books lift your spirit,
restoring a sense of faith in humanity? In this household we are currently
reading _Crime and Punishment_ and _Mockingjay_, which, in some unremembered
way, triggered this discussion. Reviewing the many books we have read in common,
we came up with a short list of those at the pinnacle for us. We ruled out
anything too obvious, e.g. no dystopian novels, and no&hellip; well, I guess we
don't even know about novels that are deliberately or obviously uplifting. I
presume they exist, but I couldn't tell you the name of one.

## Degradation

Not surprisingly, this first category was easier than the second. They left us
better understanding the dark side of the human spirit, better understanding
other cultures, and better understanding the zeitgeist of the particular
setting. They also left us with a bitter feeling toward our kind. The use of
language was beautiful in all three cases, and indeed the novels are all
technically brilliant; yet, it is unlikely that we will return to re-read these
in the next decade or more.

1. The obvious first place goes to&hellip; _The Unbearable Lightness of Being_,
   by Milan Kundera. It has been too long since I read this. Our copy went to
   Half Price to prevent a re-reading. Soviet-era repression and stagnation are
   not an excuse for being horrible people! Granted, they are _facilitators_ for
   expression of our worst qualities.
2. There is an irony in the second choice, _The Idiot_, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I
   wrote a <a
   href="/archive/2004/07/16/dostoyevskys_th/">brief
   review</a> in 2004, in which the protagonist's simplicity and understanding
   of love is mentioned. These are in contrast to the gossiping, spiteful,
   ruinous human beings he finds all around him. We find that it is impossible
   to be good and be in society.
3. Undoubtedly, I will return to Salman Rushdie's _The Moor's Last Sigh_ at some
   future date. Read more recently than the other two, there was so much to it
   that I have trouble remembering _why_ I left feeling so awful about humanity.
   The feeling, rather than the facts, remains.

Honorable (or otherwise) mentions: _Doctor Zhivago_ by Boris Pasternak, _The
Mists of Avalon_ by Marion Zimmer-Bradley.

## Upliftment

While the degradation tended to be realist fiction (or magical-realist), these
are (with one exception) decidely not. Let us not deconstruct that fact here and
now.

1. J.K. Rowling's universe in the _Harry Potter_ novels is one in which the
   students do not care about ethnicity, in which they stand up for each other
   with courage overcoming pettiness. It is a place where family still matters,
   and most importantly, where love rules on the battlefield.
2. the protagonist in _Anna Karenina_, by Leo Tolstoy, served for us as a foil
   rather than a hero. For us, the heroes were Kitty and Levin, whose
   relationship is so very pure, without becoming sappy. Their simple story is
   one of the greatest love stories ever put to paper.

The Ne(i|a)ls ("kneels") are tied:

3. the beauty of family carries Neil Gaiman's _Anansi Boys_ into this list. Part
   of the family is not exactly human &mdash; and yet in their deification they
   are extraordinarily, and endearingly, human.
4. The world of _Anathem_ by Neal Stephenson is populated by aliens with the
   same human spirit. That they are technically aliens allows for subtle shifts
   in history and culture, building a society that values knowledge so much that
   it sets scholars apart in quasi-religious orders. In the real world, scholars
   shouldn't separate themselves. But the extreme allows us to delve into the
   (presumable) uniqueness of human curiosity and powers of investigation

Honorable mention: _Speaker for the Dead_ by Orson Scott Card (disqualified
because only one of us has read it). Certain themes in the works of Charles
DeLint.

Coda: despite the darkness, I found the _Hunger Games_ trilogy more uplifting
than expected. Perhaps more on that later.
