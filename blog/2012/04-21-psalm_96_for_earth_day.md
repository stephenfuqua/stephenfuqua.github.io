> Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; \
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the sea resound, and all that is in it. \
> Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; \
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.

> _Psalm 96:11-12 (NIV)_

Let us do all humanly possible to preserve and restore heavens, earth, sea,
fields, and trees &mdash; before we find ourselves alone in our worship.
