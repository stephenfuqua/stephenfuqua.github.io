In preparation for Earth Day next weekend, I was reading a bit of [Love
God, Heal Earth](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/love-god-heal-earth-sally-g-bingham/1125043148?ean=9780980028836) this morning. I was reminded of the passage about "love thy
neighbor as thyself", and its implications for the ethics of sustainability. Who
is your neighbor? Does it include someone a state away? In another country?
Continent? What about the people of the future? This famous passage can be
interpreted, in modern context, as a call for eco-justice, which includes
leaving a sustainable way of life for future generations. Matthew, chapter 22,
verses 36 - 39 (NIV)

> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
>
> Jesus replied: "&lsquo;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
> your soul and with all your mind.&rsquo; This is the first and greatest
> commandment. And the second is like it: &lsquo;Love your neighbor as
> yourself.&rsquo;"
