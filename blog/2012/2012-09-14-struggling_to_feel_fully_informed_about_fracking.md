On the one hand, fracking has been responsible for earthquakes and creates toxic
water that must be locked away interminably. On the other hand, cheap natural
gas is replacing coal and thus lowering the projected greenhouse gas emissions
in the U.S., thanks in no small part to fracking. Furthermore, it is one of the
few growth industries in America, helping the economy recover from hard times.
They say the earthquakes can be avoided by better techniques, but I have not
heard anything positive about the water supply. In some ways, this feels worse
than nuclear fission, which provides the POTENTIAL for nasty poisoning of the
environment, whereas fracking by definition requires destruction of increasingly
scarce (at least here in Texas) water.

It would be trivial to find articles backing up the assertions above. But are
they reputable? "Whoso seeketh out a thing with zeal shall find it" [[The Seven
Valleys](http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/SVFV/svfv-1.html)]. Ultimately, I lack clear and objective information that I can
trust. So much of what is said, including by me, is about feelings and fears, to
the extent that it feels disingenous to take a real stand. That means it is time
to "investigate reality"&hellip;

To examine truth itself means to look at scientific facts and then apply them,
along with clear ethical standards, to the question at hand. It requires looking
at the totality of the impact on both people and nature, rather than the
egoistic NIMBY approach we all stumble into so often, across the political
spectrum. For fact, and policy implications, I will start my research with two
organizations I trust to present science without muddying themselves in the
waters of partisan politics &mdash; the [Union
of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/coal-and-other-fossil-fuels/how-natural-gas-works.html) and the [Nature
Conservancy](http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/newyork/placesweprotect/newyorkcity/ny1-marcellus-shale-101.xml). And perhaps I'll attend an Environmental Defense Fund webinar
this week. More to come, after some detailed reading.
