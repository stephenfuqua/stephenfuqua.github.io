_Talks by 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;: The Spirit of Christ_ is a new arrangement of
public and private talks, all previously published in _Paris Talks_ and
_Promulgation of Universal Peace_. Each talk mentions Christ; some are directly
about Christ's teachings and disciples, while others are more generally about
religion and the Prophets or "Manifestations" of God. Like a good mix tape
(playlist), the arrangement here creates a beautiful and new experience: the
reader gains a clearer and more coherent view of 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;'s theology
from these pages. This of course is an elucidation of
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h's theology; as such, this new volume would make an
excellent compliment to the study of the _Kit&aacute;b-i-&iacute;qan_.

Having just read two other books containing many excerpts from
'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;'s talks, presented in historical context, I was looking for
a followup that would present more analysis and application. When this book
arrived, I was stunned by the beautiful dust jacket and the elegant book design.
Nevertheless, I felt some initial disappointment, until I realized that these
talks are in themselves the best analysis of modern conditions and application
of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;­ teachings. Furthermore, this collection offers an
education in how to challenge an audience without putting them down and without
overwhelming them with too much information, and how to use the power of both
intellect and emotion wisely.

Although frequently commenting on the religionists of the past who were
unwilling to forsake the forms of their fathers when a new dispensation arose,
and stating in no uncertain terms that it would be better to live without
religion than to live with it when it becomes the cause of disunity, the reader
sees that his words of criticism were "mild as milk" and are expressed with a
sense forthright observation rather than fiery castigation:

> "If in the day of Jesus Christ the Jews had forsaken imitation and
> investigated reality, they would assuredly have believed in and accepted Him,
> for the Messianic effulgence was far greater than the Mosaic. The Sun of
> Reality, when it appeared from the dawning point of Christ, was as the
> midsummer sun in brilliancy and beauty".

Imagine the tone of our social discourse if the body politic could learn from this example;
and imagine if our academic discourse were devoted to building on itself rather than constantly
trying to tear each other apart. It would be a different and far more pleasant society, if we
could learn from the Master.
