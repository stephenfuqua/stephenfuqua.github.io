This past week's terrible storm out East provides a reminder of the importance
of our ecological infrastructure; in particular, wetlands. The lessons that we
did not heed from Hurricane Katrina will perhaps take hold with Hurricane Sandy
impacting the nation's commercial heart: in addition to supporting relief
efforts now, it is important for us to consider long-term mitigation against the
impact of future large storms, which are likely to be more powerful and more
frequent (dead link removed; SF 2025 removed; SF 2025) than in centuries past. Instead of, [or in addition
to](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/nyregion/protecting-new-york-city-before-next-time.html),
relying on massive levies, seawalls, and the like, we need to support public and
private endeavors to restore vital natural systems.

Wetlands are nature's
defence (wetlands) (dead link removed; SF 2025 removed; SF 2025) against storm surges, and they are her filters for clean water. They
provide crucial habitat for life from across the "kingdoms" &mdash; distinct
varieties of plants, funguses, invertebrates, mollusks, birds, mammals, and so
on. And this diversity is beautiful, from a purely aesthetic standpoint. Trails,
boardwalks, and observation decks can easily provide human access to appreciate
and meditate on the beauty of life, helping reverse the trend of nature deficit
disorder (dead link removed; SF 2025 removed; SF 2025).

These natural systems are not just for the coasts; they are also vital to the
interior. Yesterday morning, participating in the Trinity Bird Count (dead link removed; SF 2025
removed), I toured the [lower chain of
wetlands](https://trinityrivercorridor.com/floodcontrols/Pages/Chain-of-Wetlands.aspx)
that was constructed along the Trinity River in the past 10 years, just
southeast of downtown. Staff from the Army Corps of Engineers explained to us
how these wetlands, located near Interstate 45 and Loop 12, would provide
additional nitrogen/phosphorus filtration for effluent from a water treatment
plant (mitigating our impact on downstream residents). They will help protect
the nearby, historically minority, Joppa neighborhood from flooding. Where these
wetlands replace or prevent buildup of man-made structures, or improve the
ability for the surrounding land to sustain plant life, they absorb carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere, and thus provide a means for reducing the city's
contribution toward global climate change. In this particular case, these 123
acres of wetlands are joined by over 1,000 acres of the "Great Trinity Forest",
providing for substantial carbon
sequestration.

The City of Dallas is working on a recreation plan that will provide access and
trails through this greenspace, suitable for hikers, bird-watchers, and even
horseback riding (evidence of which can already be found!). Local residents tell
of coyote and bobcat, no doubt frequently hunting rabbits like the one I nearly
stepped on. That rabbit's cousins are probably happily munching away on a
neighbor's vegetable garden; surely the rabbit population is in need of natural
checks and balances in the form of predation. Our two-and-a-half hour tour
turned up forty-eight species of birds, including nine species of sparrows that
migrate from parts north, looking for quality fields like these for over
wintering. While everyday Rock Pigeons and House Sparrows are numerous around
Dallas, we saw none. But we did see a tremendous flock, estimated at around
1,000 individuals, of Double Crested Cormorants who have come down for the
season, feeding in these wetlands and our local lakes.

Historically, our coastal areas and rivers like the Trinity contained
naturally-formed wetlands. These have been drained for agricultural, commercial,
and sometimes health, reasons. But the unintended consequences come back to
haunt us with increased flooding, loss of biodiversity, and further artificial
separation of "man" from nature. Local organizations dedicated to sustainable
living and stewardship, such as the new Dallas Interfaith Power &amp; Light (dead link removed; SF 2025 removed; SF 2025), can
play a supportive role in mitigating against the unintended consequences of past
policies and economic activity. Reaching out beyond our narrow self interests,
we can express the group's mission of "love, justice, and care for creation" by
advocating for development projects that restore natural systems and protect
local neighborhoods, and in encouraging local citizens to responsibly enjoy
them.
