The EPA has a proposed new standard for fossil fuel-burning power plants, which
will be constructed in the future, that will help ensure a lower carbon future
and hopefully spur innovation in the electric industry. They are accepting
public comments through June 25<sup>th</sup>. Â There are a number of
organizations that will help you provide comments directly to the EPA, such as
the National
Council of Churches (dead link removed; SF 2025) or the Union
of Concerned Scientists (dead link removed; SF 2025). My letter, with extra citations, is below.

Dear Administrator Jackson,

I am writing in support of the proposed "new source performance standards" [1]
for fossil fuel power plants (Docket number EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0660).

It is now well established that Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are a form of
pollution that damage the health and well-being of our communities - in American
and abroad [2]. Global climate change, largely driven by anthropogenic GHG
releases [3], is known to be causing present disruptions to our weather
patterns, consequently affecting agriculture, biodiversity, and extreme weather
events [4]. These effects are widespread. Mitigating them should be a concern
for all who care about their neighbors near and far, the Earth on which we
depend, and the richness of life that gives physical and spiritual sustenance to
us.

Although market forces are inexorably pushing the power-generating economy in a
more sustainable direction, the ecosystems we live and breathe in, that nourish
and nurture us, cannot continue waiting for us to clean up our act. We need
strong federal regulations, such as this proposed standard for new power plants,
to provide a uniform push toward a lower environmental impact from the
electricity driving our daily lives. By placing these reasonable constraints on
industry, investment and innovation will be channeled in directions more
conducive to the amelioration of our impact on the Earth [5].

Although much more work must be done to prevent the harm we are doing to the
Earth and to our fellow humans from becoming permanent [6], this standard is a
good step toward ensuring a lower GHG future in the United States. I support the
EPA's efforts to finalize these rules as they stand or in an even stronger
variation.

Sincerely,

Stephen A. Fuqua \
