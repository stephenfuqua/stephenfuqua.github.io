Currently I'm working on updating the main blog at safnet.com with a refreshed
look and feel (the design was last changed "way back" in 2008), then I'll move
on to this technical blog. In the meantime, this garish built-in template will
serve to remind me that work needs to be done.

New tech-blog entries have been rare primarily because I have been spending much
of my technical-writing time on internal documentation at work: trying to
build-up a thorough set of documentation in a SharePoint Wiki. Most of that
content is proprietary, and would not be useful outside the company anyway. But
I do hope to start posting comments here again soon, starting with a few
entries after recently reading the classic _The Mythical Man-Month_.
