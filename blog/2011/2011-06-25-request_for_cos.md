_Letter to Congresswoman McCollum, and Senators Franken and Klobuchar:_

The recent harrowing arrest of faculty and administrators of the Baha'i
Institute for Higher Education in Iran has once again highlighted the subtle and
extreme actions in which  the current Iranian government is willing to engage in
order to suppress the free expression of worship by the Baha'is of Iran.

This world is sadly riven with manifest injustice, often in the form of a
government's abuse of its own people. Our most potent weapon against injustice
is truth, in speech and deed. In a free land, who can deny that the treatment of
the Iranian Baha'is -- unable to administer their affairs, to attend the
official schools, to gather in communal worship of that same God to whom most of
the world's peoples turn in prayer -- is unjust and unworthy of any nation?

The documentation is evident, widespread, and objective. There is a plain
agenda, at the highest levels of government, to eradicate the supposed heresy of
"Bahaism" in its homeland. The United States government has been a friend to the
Baha'is in the past, offering the stern judgment of a nation wishing to see
peace in the world. With the renewed and intensified persecution of the past few
years, it is time for the U.S. Congress to join Secretary of State Clinton in
remembering the Baha'i community in Iran, by raising its voice in truth, raising
its voice in condemnation of the Iranian government's actions against the
Baha'is and other religious minorities.

Please, join with forty-five of your colleagues in co-sponsoring House
Resolution 134, and in urging that it be brought for a floor vote soon.
