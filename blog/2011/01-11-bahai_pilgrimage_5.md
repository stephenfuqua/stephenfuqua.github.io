While it was unfortunate that we were not able to see the Shrine of the
B&aacute;b in all its golden-domed grandeur (covered over during on-going
rehab), we had the bounty of being only the third pilgrim group to visit the
restored [Ridv&aacute;n Garden](https://www.bahaullah.org/ridvan/) outside of
'Akk&aacute;. The Bah&aacute;'&iacute; World News Service has an excellent
article, from October 2010, on the restoration work and the history of the
garden: [Holy place restoration sheds light on region's
heritage](https://news.bahai.org/story/797).

It is indeed a beautiful and calming place, and one can well imagine the relief
of leaving the horrid conditions of the city to spend a few hours in joyful
company on the island. This entire complex is filled with trees and plants
descended from those brought across the deserts by pilgrims from Persia (as
mentioned somewhere in _The Chosen Highway_), particularly cypress, pomegranate,
and various citrus fruits (the tangerines were ripe and wonderful!). The peace
and tranquility in this site, which is only a few hundred yards from apartment
buildings, could easily send one into a rapturous state.

Entrance to the Garden of Ridv&aacute;n, which is outside Akka and very near
"Napeoleon's Hill" (under which lies the ancient city of 'Akk&aacute;. [This website](https://www.biblewalks.com/Sites/TellAkko.html) has an

Standing on the "mainland", with the rocks in the foreground being the other
side of the near channel, the benches mark the far side of the small island.

At the very back the island, the small brick structure is the former
donkey-driven pump for the fountain. The channel seen here was recreated in the
last few years, after the British had drained the area in the early 20th
century.

The "verdant isle" of the Ridv&aacute;n Garden, with a young citrus grove and
the 100+ year old palm (the skinny one).

This mulberry tree was witness to Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h's visits to the
island in the 1880s.

On a windy day, I marvelled at the longevity of this skinny date palm, which was
alive during the time of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h's visits to the island.
