Dr. Brooks is my new&hellip; well, I can't think of an appropriate noun. Certainly
not a deity. One book does not make him a favorite tech author. Static text cannot make
him a mentor. Maybe tech hero?

_The Mythical Man-Month_ is a true classic. Many have heard of it; I wonder how
many in my generation have taken the time to read it? Although it was written
primarily* in the mid-seventies, based on experiences from the mid-sixties, it
nevertheless offers

1. Brilliant insights on the working of computers and software;
2. Brilliant insights on the workings of the people who work on them;
3. Unintentional but illuminating lessons in history;
4. A powerful argument for the importance of _process_ but against its ossification;
5. And of course, much sage advice.

(* the copy I found at a Half-Price is a 20th-anniversary edition with
additional information, and valuable, essays written in the eighties and
nineties).

This post will begin a series of reflections based on little sticky notes I used
to remind myself of Lessons Learned or To Be Explored. That in itself was a
lesson learned, but from elsewhere. I had probably thought to do it before, but
was too frugal to "waste" my sticky notes this way. Should've been doing this
for years.
