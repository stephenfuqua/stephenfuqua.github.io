This [year's
drought](http://www.google.com/search?q=texas+drought&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a) has brought the stark reality of water availability front-and-center
in Texas. The state has faced droughts before &mdash; but by all accounts, this
is one of the most severe, and the population continues to expand rapidly. Water
is not entirely taken for granted in this state, especially in central and west
Texas, but this year's experience seems to have struck home for people in a
profound way. Even as we have begun to get some sporadic rain, the talk of stage
4 water rationing continues. And yet there are also stories of people flouting
the rules, watering away in their yards. I wish I could accompany those folks on
a visit out to <a href="http://www.wetlandcenter.com/">John Bunker Sands
Wetlands Center</a>.

[Alex Steffen](http://www.alexsteffen.com/), introducing the water
segment of _World Changing, A User's Guide to the 21<sup>st</sup> Century_,
describes our attitudes well when he writes that "&hellip; the need to measure
and plan and remain constantly aware of our water use is real. Although we know
that water is an extremely limited resource, most of us in the Global North
don't experience a sense of responsibility as we watch it flow into the drain.
&hellip; We rinse a dusty glass and allow nearly clean water to be piped miles
away to a sewage-treatment plant. Then we complain that water rates are too
high." (p190).

The John Bunker Sands Wetlands Center provides a fascinating glimpse into North
Texas water usage. It is a unique public/private partnership, part of the East
Fork Wetlands Project, where treated water is being filtered through a man-made
wetland, thereby removing much of the phosphorus, nitrogen, and ammonia that
remains after sewage treatment. The water is then pumped back to Lake Lavon,
which supplies the water for most of the suburbs north and east of Dallas (the
next lake on the river, Ray Hubbard, supplies Dallas itself). The Center
showcases this work and, incidentally, includes a beautiful series of boardwalks
where one can learn about water-loving plants up close, watch for any of
hundreds of species of birds, perhaps run into a river otter (or nutria), and
one day, hopefully, American alligators.

I had the pleasure of tagging along with the [Indian Trails Master Naturalist](http://txmn.org/indiantrail/about/)
group today, as the Center Director John DeFillipo gave a talk about the
Wetlands Project. I already do what I can to conserve water, but it is out of an
arms-length sense of civic duty more than a deep understanding of how North
Texas gets it water. His presentation gave me a new appreciation for the water I
grew up with, and for the diverse flora and fauna of North Texas. For instance:

* As a kid in the northern Dallas area, I knew that we drank lake water &mdash;
  but I didn't know which lake (Lavon), and I didn't know that _the lake is
  partially filled by transporting water from Lake Texoma, in Oklahoma_ &mdash;
  that is, until <a
  href="http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Water-district-decision-could-bring-unwanted-guest-to-Lake-Lavon-111408749.html">zebra
  mussels were found</a> in Texoma. I always assumed that lake water would come
  only from the watershed that drains into it, without being pumped from
  elsewhere.
* While I've read about the severe competition for water in Colorado, I had
  never thought about it in such terms in Texas. We might be heading that same
  direction, if the drought lasts as long as some expect.
* Along those lines &mdash; as part of this project, the North Texas Municipal
  Water District must carefully measure the flow of all water entering Lake
  Lavon, and all water entering the East Fork River from several sewage
  treatment centers. It must then use those measurements to calibrate the flow
  from the river into the wetlands, maintaining  a reasonable flow of water
  south of the river.
* I had no idea that <a
  href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/newsmedia/releases/?req=20100209a">river
  otters</a> and <a
  href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/americanalligator/">American
  alligator</a> lived in the Dallas area. Beaver also visit the wetlands; I knew
  about them thanks to a story in the mid-90s when one made the papers after
  being trapped in a parking garage in northwestern Plano. One of the
  participants actually saw an otter playfully chasing ducks.

The wetlands also serve a powerful lesson in impermanence: the land was once
hardwood bottomland along the river; it was cleared by white settlers to become
cotton farms; for much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century it was  (and parts still
are) a cattle ranch; and now a few thousand acres have been engineered into
functioning wetland, providing habitat for innumerable species and providing a
valuable service for humans. It is all too easy to look out at a parcel of
ranch, farm, or blighted development and assume that is the now-permanent state.
This site teaches us that, given enough time and/or ingenuity, we can conserve
our resources, restore the land, and live more sustainably &mdash; if we have
the will to do so.

I've just confirmed &mdash; my local water comes from [Joe Pool Lake](http://www.trinityra.org/default.asp?contentID=113).
