A friend asked about the need for the concept of "fear of God" in the
Bah&aacute;&iacute; Faith. Can one be a Bah&aacute;&iacute; without it? More
generally, do Bah&aacute;&iacute;s accept that there can be compassion and
altruism without this "fear"? I found the simple answer today: no (read on for
the references). But as with so many concepts, it seems important to dig into
the words, exploring their literal and symbolic meaning both inclusive of and
apart from our pre-conceived notions.

I grew up with two different poles to the "fear of God". On the one hand there
was the dread of judgment and eternal damnation &mdash; a never-ending series of
torments where the only change is the devising of new tortures. This Dantean
vision well fits the _American Heritage Dictionary_'s first definition of
"fear": "A feeling of agitation and anxiety caused by the presence or imminence
of danger." On the other hand was the softer "feeling of disquiet or
apprehension" (definition 2) about the _loss of love and approval_ by
displeasing God, which was a fear based more on love than punishment. Both poles
clearly fit within the "big tent" of Christianity. Indeed, I feel like I learned
both concepts at the same time in Vacation Bible School when I was quite young.
A third definition of "fear" is offered: "Extreme reverence or awe, as toward a
supreme power." Again, this version of the word can certainly be found in
Christianity as well, and all three have clear precedents in Judaism (I leave
the web search to the reader).

The Dantean vision never resonated with me. It might have been appropriate for a
particular age of the world, but not in today's world where superstition has
been burned away. The second and third senses have always held me in line
&mdash; although  as a child it was more the fear of disappointing my parents
that kept me in line than the fear of the Divine. So much for pre-conceived
notions, now on to authoritative Bah&aacute;'&iacute; writings.

Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h makes plain that "fear of God" plays an important role
in humanity's ordered life:

> "... Verily I say: The fear of God hath ever been a sure defence and a safe
> stronghold for all the peoples of the world. It is the chief cause of the
> protection of mankind, and the supreme instrument for its preservation.
> Indeed, there existeth in man a faculty whihch deterreth him from, and
> guardeth him against, whatever is unworthy and unseemly, and which is known as
> his sense of shame. this, however, is confined to but a few; all have not
> possessed and do not possess it."
>
> _Tablets of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h revealed after the Kit&aacute;b-i-Aqdas_, p 63

But which sense is this? The explicit linking of "fear" and "shame" lead me
toward the second definition, and it is interesting in-and-of itself. Shoghi
Effendi  elucidated this concept, in a letter written on his behalf in 1946,
quoted in _Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Education, A Compilation_:

> "You ask him about the fear of God: perhaps the friends do not realize that
> the majority of human beings need the element of fear in order to discipline
> their conduct? Only a relatively very highly evolved soul would always be
> disciplined by love alone. Fear of punishment, fear of the anger of God if we
> do evil, are needed to keep people's feet on the right path. Of course we
> should love God &mdash; but we must fear Him in the sense of a child fearing
> the righteous anger and chastisement of a parent; not cringe before Him as
> before a tyrant, but know His mercy exceeds His Justice!"

In another letter, dated 1940, Shoghi Effendi wrote that "Fear of God" "...
often means awe, but has also other connotations such as reverence, terror and
fear." So, as with Christianity, all definitions of the concept can be found
within the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith. But, for the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s, the
"fear of God" is utterly devoid of devils, hellfire, brimstones, etc. There are
certainly passages in the Writings that use the word "hell" in its traditional
context. But Shoghi Effendi interestingly states that "Heaven and Hell are
conditions within our own beings" (_High Endeavours: Messages to Alaska_, p50).
'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; goes further in linking "hell" to an inner condition rather
than a physical reality:

> "The root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and we must therefore hold fast to
> the tools of perception and knowledge. Good character must be taught. Light must
> be spread afar, so that, in the school of humanity, all may acquire the heavenly
> characteristics of the spirit, and see for themselves beyond any doubt that
> there is no fiercer Hell, no more fiery abyss, than to possess a character that
> is evil and unsound; no more darksome pit nor loathsome torment than to show
> forth qualities which deserve to be condemned."
>
> _Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;_, Sec. 111

Yes, the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s hold to a concept of the Fear of God, but it is
not rooted in eternal torment and Divine Retribution. Further, anecdotally
speaking, "fear of God" is not prevalent in the daily discourse and worldview of
the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s I have known &mdash; acting out of love and compassion
is much more so. I have found no other references expounding on the nature of
this fear; in the absence of clear and authoritative interpretation, it is up to
each of us to understand this notion, to let it shape our actions and our
philosophies.
