In responding to a friend about the nature of the "god concept" in the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith, I began to collect a number of passages and add a
few comments as to why I chose them. And then I found this hitherto unknown (to
me) statement from 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;. It could not be more plain, and
completely justifies what a fellow Bah&aacute;'&iacute; once said to an
atheistically-inclined friend: "I don't believe in the same God you don't
believe in."

The futility of trying to understand God &mdash; leaving one "despairing, ...
hopes in ruin" &mdash; reminds me of the Buddha's [parable
of the poisoned arrow](https://encyclopediaofbuddhism.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_poisoned_arrow), which I first encountered in Huston Smith's _World
Religions_. In it He describes a man who dies of an arrow wound because he is
insistent on learning everything about the arrow and the person who shot it.
Rather, he should focus on his actions and suffering in the here and now, not on
the essence of metaphysics.
