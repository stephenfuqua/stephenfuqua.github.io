A friend recently told me about this passage from the collection of
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h's writings called _Prayers and Meditations_. In
Facebook conversation I've been talking about my limited and impersonal
understanding of "God". This passage might seem a bit paradoxical to that
viewpoint, at first glance. The paradox is because of my  inability to precisely
describe the nuance of a belief that lies somewhere between the poles of atheism
and personal theism, without recourse to philosophical language (the best
"school of thought" to describe my own core belief has always been [panentheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panentheism)).

Now, this particular paragraph could lead one to assume that
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h is positing a pantheistic viewpoint of God. Other
parts of the meditation offer a more personal/anthropomorphic approach. However,
elswhere we are warned about literal reliance on anthropomorphism:

> However, let none construe these utterances to be anthropomorphism, nor see in
> them the descent of the worlds of God into the grades of the creatures; nor
> should they lead thine Eminence to such assumptions. For God is, in His
> Essence, holy above ascent and descent, entrance and exit; He hath through all
> eternity been free of the attributes of human creatures, and ever will remain
> so. No man hath ever known Him; no soul hath ever found the pathway to His
> Being. Every mystic knower hath wandered far astray in the valley of the
> knowledge of Him; every saint hath lost his way in seeking to comprehend His
> Essence. Sanctified is He above the understanding of the wise; exalted is He
> above the knowledge of the knowing! The way is barred and to seek it is
> impiety; His proof is His signs; His being is His evidence.

The reason for the anthropomorphic-seeming statements is not stated; I can only
assume that the terminology is used as a metaphorical device that helps us puny
humans connect to this inscrutable force-Being. But of pantheism itself,
'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; makes clear that this concept is too limiting of God in His
Father's theology (_Some Answered Questions_, [p290-6](https://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-83.html); the
discussion of this concept is too philosophical, and wrapped around particular
S&uacute;f&iacute; beliefs, for quoting any particular part here).

From these passages, and others yet to be quoted, I find space in the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith for my demi-belief, my
[panentheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panentheism) that admits of an
impersonal "divinity" that is both immanent and transcendent. It would be
arrogant in the extreme to assume my belief is the correct one; rather, it is
simply my way of getting by, and helping me to focus on becoming a better person
and  creating a better civilization. It doesn't matter to me if it is ultimately
right or wrong; if it helps anyone else see a way to connect their own souls to
the Supreme Being, then I am happy for them.
