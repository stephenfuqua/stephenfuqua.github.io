Many of the recommendations Dr. Brooks makes in this work can seem outdated at
first glance; however, it does not take much to bring them into today's software
development environments. Take the _telephone log_ for example:

> "One useful mechanism is a _telephone log_ kept by the architect. In it he
> records every question and every answer. Each week the logs of the several
> architects are concatenated, reproduced, and distributed to the users and
> implementers. While this mechanism is quite informal, it is both quick and
> comprehensive." (p69)

Read the book for more context. Updated in modern terms: as an architect, or any
kind of _subject matter expert_ (SME), questions and answers over the phone,
e-mail, or in-person should spawn an update to the enterprise Wiki (addition or
clarification). Consider pro-actively sending a list of updated Wiki pages at
least once a week, or even in a brief daily status update. If the answer to an
active question is already there, find a polite way to direct the questioner to
the Wiki. Here's where good customer service is important. In many cases this
might be a missed opportunity to be of service:

> One-line e-mail: "Did you look in the Wiki?"

One can imagine a much snarkier-sounding e-mail coming from a frustrated
developer who does not want to be interrupted with "trivialities." But that's an
unfortunate attitude, one that fails to recognize the importance of respect and
service to other group/team members, without whom the developer's job might be
meaningless. Perhaps a better response would be:

> "Yes, I had a difficult time understanding that as well. We've documented that
> in the Wiki; please click under XXXXXX and then find the link with YYYYY in
> it."

Better yet, if time permits: copy and paste from the Wiki into an e-mail, and
include the Wiki link for future reference. This is, of course, a double-edged
sword. Somehow, someway, "users and implementers" must be encouraged to read the
documentation for themselves, and discouraged from asking a thousand questions
that have already been answered.

I do not recall that Brooks's sagacity encompassed this area. The best that I've
come up with is this: offer to schedule an hour with the individual later in the
day/week, and ask the individual to hold all but the most critical questions
until that time. This gives the person an opportunity to find their own answers,
allows you to continue focusing on your current efforts, and the face-to-face
time may even be more appreciated than the individual responses would have been.
