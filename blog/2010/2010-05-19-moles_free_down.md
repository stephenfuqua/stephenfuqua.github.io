I wonder how many others didn't think to scroll down further on the Pex download
page, and find this link? [Visual
Studio 2010 Moles - Isolation Framework for .NET](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b3b41648-1c21-471f-a2b0-f76d8fb932ee). Moles is available for
free, while the full Pex environment requires MSDN.
