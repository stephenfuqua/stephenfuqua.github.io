I took my nook on pilgrimage, with a whole slew of Bah&aacute;'&iacute; e-books.
I realized after the first day that I wanted to read a first-hand account from a
pilgrim who visited the Holy Land during the time of the Master,
'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;. I had already read _God Passes By_ just last year, _The
Dawnbreakers_ some years ago, _Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h and the New Era_ fairly
recently, and several other books dealing with Bab&iacute; and
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; history. So I decided to try out Lady Blomfield's _The
Chosen Highway_ &mdash; and was well-rewarded for it.

The books is written in a semi-epistolary style, which struck me as a very odd
way of presenting a history. But it worked. Lady Blomfield's aim was to give a
sense of the times, to share with others around her what had occurred in the
Master's trip to the West and what she had learned from the Master's family in
Haifa on her own pilgrimage. The goal was not to present an academically-rigours
historical treatise.

The stories she tells are consistent with other histories, and many of them are
based on interviews with the women of the Holy family &mdash; including Bahiyyih
Khanum, Munirih Khanum, and others. Reading their perspectives on the exiles is
fascinating. They were able to share insights that made the pilgrimage
experience deeper, such as details of the difficulty of the passage from
Gallipoli to Akka; the joy at leaving the Citadel mixed with the oppression of
being essentially locked away in the House of Abbud; the fear for the Master
when the Turkish authorities were seeking an excuse to execute him. These
stories are made richer through their sharing, and Lady Blomfield expertly
navigates the cultural differences in bringing them to light for a western
audience.

Shoghi Effendi's _God Passes By_ clearly remains the pre-eminent book for
understanding the momentous events of Bah&aacute;'&iacute; history. _The Chosen
Highway_ makes an excellent companion, and is quite frankly an easier read. I
cannot recommend it more highly.
