This year is the  tenth anniversary of the charter signing of the United
Religions Initiative. To mark the occasion, the URI has launched a brand-new,
gorgeously-professional <a href="http://www.uri.org">website</a>. If you have
interest in the world of interfaith action and cooperation that is "bound for
peace", then I invite you to stop by the site. I've not been so involved with
the URI's work in the past few years, but I am still proud to call myself a
supporter of this dynamic, idealistic-yet-grounded organization.
