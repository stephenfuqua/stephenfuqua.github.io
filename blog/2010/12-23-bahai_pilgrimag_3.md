Four members of the "Holy Family" are buried in the second major development of
the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; World Centre (the prior being the mausoleum of the [B&aacute;b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1b)): [&Aacute;s&iacute;yih
Kh&aacute;num](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81s%C3%ADyih_Kh%C3%A1num) (the "Most Exalted Leaf", "Navv&aacute;b"), wife of
Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, their children [Bah&iacute;yyih
Kh&aacute;num](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahiyyih_Kh%C3%A1num) (the "Greatest Holy Leaf") and [M&iacute;rz&aacute;
Mihd&iacute;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%ADrz%C3%A1_Mihd%C3%AD) (the "Purest Branch"), and [Mun&iacute;rih
Kh&aacute;num](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mun%C3%ADrih_Kh%C3%A1num), wife of 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;. Although it is not part of the
scheduled tour of holy places, we felt it was essential that we pay our respects
to these departed souls, who gave everything to the Faith.

Assessing their individual legacies is difficult today, particularly for the
women. M&iacute;rz&aacute; Mihd&iacute;'s death played an integral role in
allowing visitors to come to 'Akk&aacute;, a story related in many histories.
But the roles of the women are unsurprisingly challenging to uncover &mdash;
although as Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s they had unequaled freedom within their own
homes, the laws of the land greatly restricted their movements. Recent
scholarship has begun to uncover their roles. One example of this is _Prophet's
Daughter_, which I read and [reviewed](http://www.safnet.com/writing/archives/000264.html) a few
years ago. Thanks to that work, in no place did I feel as physically moved as I
did in Bah&iacute;yyih Kh&aacute;num's room in the House of 'Abbud. The book
_The Chosen Highway_, [reviewed a few days
ago](http://www.safnet.com/writing/archives/000423.html), helps shed light on the predicaments of their families, but does little
to elucidate the spiritual roles they played: they were more than just
supportive spouses/sister. They also played crucial roles in holding the Faith
together during the early years after 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;'s death, and in
encouraging and promoting women in their quest to establish the reality of
equality in their families and communities. I look forward to learning more
about them &mdash; planning on picking up [Leaves
of the Twin Divine Trees](http://www.amazon.com/Leaves-Divine-Trees-Baharieh-Rouhani/dp/0853985332) in 2011.
