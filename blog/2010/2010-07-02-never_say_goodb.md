I've been a recycling fool since I was in elementary school, when my best friend
and I would walk around house construction sites and collect all of the aluminum
cans (we weren't the least bit bothered if there were workers actually there,
though typically we were out on Saturdays and that wasn't an issue). For years
now I've been meaning to send my old floppy disks to [Green Disk](http://www.greendisk.com/), and tonight we finally boxed
them up for shipping tomorrow: floppy and zip disks, DSL modems, an ancient
dubbed-from-broadcast Spaceballs on VHS (and a few other VHS).

The _coup de gr&acirc;ce_: Bon Jovi's _Slippery When Wet_. I had to open the
liner notes and read/semi-sing  the, shall we just leave it at trite, lyrics to
Never Say Goodbye. But I was forced to give up half way through. That was about
the last audio cassette tape. I think I still have The Cure's _Faith/Carnage
Visors_, and REM's _Carnival of Sorts_, because those were rather rare even in
their time.

Next on the recycling list: my old soccer, debate, and science competition
trophies (about a dozen).
