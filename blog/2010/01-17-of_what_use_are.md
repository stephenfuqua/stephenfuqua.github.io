They are the aliment of imagination, \
The wellspring of delight. \
They turn stars into heroes, \
Bring peace to the night.

Fear they can banish, \
And in good measure bestow. \
All good stories teach; \
Even heroes they bring low.

Words are more than letters, \
As letters are more than lines. \
In the mirror of darkest tales,  \
Verily even sorrow shines.

When polished in contemplation, \
The reflection you will find, \
Far eclipses all that \
The narrator had in mind.
