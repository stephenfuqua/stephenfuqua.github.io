Did you know that many Bah&aacute;'&iacute; books are available for free
download onto your computer, smartphone, or e-reader?

* At [http://reference.bahai.org](https://reference.bahai.org) you can
  click on an author's name to see a list of books, including all published
  translations from the Central Figures, the writings of Shoghi Effendi, and a
  few other works. To the right of the book title are two small icons that you
  can click to download that book: one as a Microsoft Word document and another
  as an adobe PDF document. Both are zip files that require a program like
  WinZip or 7-Zip to open (newer computers will also have built-in capability
  to open these zip files).
* Palabra Publications offers many compilations of letters from the House of
  Justice, as well as books on deepening themes written by Melanie Smith, Paul
  Lample, and Dr. A.M. Ghadirian. This includes Lample's [_Creating a New
  Mind_](https://palabrapublications.com/products/235?_pos=1&_psq=Creating+a+New+Mind&_ss=e&_v=1.0)
  and his new [_Revelation &amp; Social
  Reality_](https://palabrapublications.com/products/revelation-social-reality)
* [The Gutenberg project](https://www.gutenberg.org) aims to preserve
  a digital collection of tens of thousands of public domain books: those whose
  copyright has expired, or whose authors have placed the books into the public
  domain. All of the works at reference.bahai.org are also found here. In
  addition, you can find:
  * Under "Baha'i International Community" as author - _Century of Light_, _One
    Common Faith_, _The Prosperity of Humankind_, _Statement on Baha'u'llah_.
  * Under "Baha'i World Centre" - _Bahiyyih Khan&uacute;m_
