Finished _Dune Messiah_ (2nd time, read 6-7 years ago too?). We all recognize
that Tattoine is more than a little Dune-like, and the Sarlac pit is a great nod
to Shai-hulud. I'm sure I'm not the first to notice that Annakin had some level
of prescience. His prescience warned him of his wife's death. But he accepted the
bargain, became a tool. Thence the jihad and establishment of empire. Slightly
twisted &mdash; Annakin is right hand, rather than Imperator, and jihad occurs
post-death rather than ante-. And then I remembered the twins.

What other links exist? A number of minor things (Alia/Leia, Leto/Luke...), as
pointed out at [Star Wars Origins](http://www.moongadget.com/origins/dune.html).
That site of course reminds us what already know: "What has been will be again,
what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun". So I
can't really can't hold it against Lucas if he borrowed liberally from Herbert
and Kurosawa.
