I wonder how many others didn't think to scroll down further on the Pex download
page, and find this link? [Visual
Studio 2010 Moles - Isolation Framework for .NET](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Peli.VisualStudio2010Molesx64-IsolationFrameworkforNET). Moles is available for
free, while the full Pex environment requires MSDN.
