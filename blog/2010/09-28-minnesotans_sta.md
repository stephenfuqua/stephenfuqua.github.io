"O people! Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of
friendliness and fellowship," Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h commanded his own followers in His
epistle of the [Glad Tidings](https://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html).

In that spirit I, and three to four-hundred others, ventured to downtown
Minneapolis this evening for _Minnesotans Standing Together - A multi-faith
prayer service for respect_. The service began and ended with bagpipes,
surrounding comments, prayers, songs, chanting, and meditation from the
Christian (Lutheran, Unitarian, Catholic), Jewish, Muslim, Hindu,
Bah&aacute;'&iacute;, and Buddhist faith traditions (a Lakota speaker was
unfortunately absent). These were words of unity, love, and respect for one
another &mdash; and a call to actively show those feelings, to uphold them in society
in the face of enmity, rancor, and hate.
