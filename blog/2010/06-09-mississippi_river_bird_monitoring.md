I've just uploaded some statistics for the [Mississippi River Twin
Cities Landbird Monitoring Project](http://www.ibamonitoring.org). Go into an individual species and you
can see a color-coded table of results, histogram showing species presence over
time, and a Google maps display with the count of birds at each exact point
count location within the various sites monitored. Interestingly, Gold Finchs
are the most common bird across these parks. Its definitely fun to pour through
this data. Later in the summer, data from previous years will be loaded into the
site as well. Check out the Great-Crested Flycatcher &mdash; at 8 of 9 sites,
they showed up all at the same time (week of 5/9). I can't wait to compare that
to previous years' migration results.
