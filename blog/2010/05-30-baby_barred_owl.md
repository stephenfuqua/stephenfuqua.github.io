This morning at Battle Creek West, where we saw an adult Barred Owl drying
itself after a bath two weeks ago, we found two fledged babies. They were
adorable. If human babies looked like this, we might have a few already. Someone else's
great photo (dead link removed; SF 2025).

Also seen, in another part of the park: small milkweed plant with a monarch egg
and 2nd molt monarch caterpillar, and flying nearby was an adult monarch. Seeing
three stages of monarch within a minute was quite gratifying. Next time we're
out there (two weeks) we'll have to check in on their progress. (T. is now
associated with the Monarch Larva Monitoring
Project.)
