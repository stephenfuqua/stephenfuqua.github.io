We returned yesterday from our Bah&aacute;'&iacute; pilgrimage. Pilgrimage to
the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; holy places is enjoined in Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;'s
_Most Holy Book_, if one is able to undertake the travel. I was careful to avoid
having too many specific expectations, instead being open to all the experiences
I would encounter. For some the pilgrimage is a transformative experience. I
would not label it thusly for me, but it was certainly a meaningful and
memorable experience that I hope I can use to galvanize myself to further
personal development.

This post will be the first in a series of posts and photos about my experience.
Many people have shared their stories on the web, and I don't expect mine to be
particularly unique or illuminating. But compiling them here seems like the best
way for me to digest the experience, and stretch it into the future.

For official public information on the "Bah&aacute;'&iacute; gardens" in Israel
(two of the primary locations we visited), there is a very informative (and
relatively new) [public web site](http://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/). As
I compile my experiences, I plan on linking to many historical stories regarding
the various places visited, which illuminate the importance of these sites to
Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s.
