The word "confirmation" is used by some in a spiritual sense, something akin to
signs and portents: an experience that validates, proves, or explains a previous
feeling, decision, or action i.e. "... ask for you all divine guidance and
confirmation in the very important work you are directing" [
[1](http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MC/mc-38.html?query=confirmation&amp;action=highlight#gr1)]. It is natural to ask, "what is the agent of this confirmation?" To the
traditionally theistic, that answer is obvious: God. To the athiest, the answer
is probably something along the lines of "Whoso seeketh out a thing with zeal
shall find it." [[2](http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/SVFV/svfv-1.html#fn12)]
(self-fulfilling). Truthfully, my attitude towards the concept has traditionally
been dismissive.

It was while studying _ [
Raising up Animators of Junior Youth Groups](http://www.ruhiresources.org/book-5/raising-up-animators-of-junior-youth-groups/)_ last year that I started fully
thinking about my attitude toward this concept. In several ways, the junior
youth group program encourages its participants to think about, and act on, this
notion. In particular, I recall lessons that encouraged these young people to
look for _ confirmation_ of their paths in life: in some instances, the sign of
confirmation is something abstract (a bird started singing beautifully while I
was thinking about ....), and in others more concrete (I've long thought about
being a nurse; recently I helped take care of my ill grandmother, and while I
was sad about her condition, it gave me a wonderful feeling to be able to
provide that service to her). (not exact examples from the book).

This sense of confirmation is also used by activist groups, on the left and the
right, when moralizing about a particular position. Left: overcrowded chickens
lead to [
salmonella](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_2e05d659-1f25-5ec3-91fa-8a6bca558f21.html) in eggs! That's your punishment for keeping chickens in-humanely
cooped up! Right: gay sex accounts for [64%](http://www.avert.org/usa-transmission-gender.htm) of new HIV cases
in the U.S. We told you that homosexuality is wrong and God would take revenge!
Frankly, social-moralizing _confirmations_ better have strong _scientific_
cause-and-effect, must be clearly linked to a _real_ social ill, and should seek
constructive solutions that unite rather than divide, if they are to sway me. In
that case, we call it public policy rather than moralizing, and we're speaking
on a material level rather than spiritual.

Is my dismissive attitude justified? Religiously speaking, the concept is so
intrinsic that it is difficult to find explicit law or principle in its belief.
That is, I have not found anything that says "as a Baha'i, you should believe in
'confirmations from God'". But to dismiss the idea outright, without at least
some sort of accomodation, seems like an implicit dismissal of any concept of
the supernatural, and therefore of religion as somethign more than a social
movement. Given that I have found a way to accomodate the supernatural in my
scientific worldview &mdash; as the patterns and organization emergent from the
complexity of the universe(s), civilization, etc. &mdash; perhaps there is room
for _confirmations_ as well, probably as something in between
"hitherto-unknown-force impinging itself on my life" and "self-fulfilling
prophecy / wish-fulfilment".
