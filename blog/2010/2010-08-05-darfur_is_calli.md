Save Darfur Coalition just called me. And thanked me for being so pleasant on
the phone. How sad. Its not like it was a cold call &mdash; I've supported them
in the past and thus have a reasonable expectation that they'll try to contact
me in the future. Why are they calling? Because apparently the conditions in
Darfur are deteriorating. Do I believe the woman on the phone? Well, the Times
reports that [Violence Said
to Be Rising in Sudan&#8217;s Darfur Region](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/world/africa/05sudan.html) (2010-08-05). At this point Sudan
is as much a powder-keg as ever, with secession of the south likely next year,
renewed civil war equally likely. The Save
Darfur Coalition< is helping spread awareness of, and global pressure on, the
Sudanese government's grave abuses (killings, rapes, and other human rights
violations). My money will not do much to stop the situation. But public
pressure does make a difference, and I'll provide a small amount to help keep
that pressure steady.

Meanwhile, Pakistan is also calling, though not literally. The flooding has been
absolutely terrible, and relief agencies expect that hunger and isolation will
be extreme in the coming months. Time to step up and show the love
again for Pakistan (dead link removed). Unicef, World Food Programm, International Committee of
the Red Cross, Oxfam, etc. &mdash; let's all give one of them a cold call, only
to give rather than receive.
