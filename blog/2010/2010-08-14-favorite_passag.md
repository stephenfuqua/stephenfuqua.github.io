The Times has a special feature about [On
the Origin of Species](http://documents.nytimes.com/charles-darwin-on-the-origin-of-species?ref=science#annotation/a0), including annotations from various Scientists
commenting on favorite passages. The first annotation is by the famous
primatologist Frans de Waal, who comments one of the passages that struck my
interest when I read the book earlier this year:

> I should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and
> metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and
> including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but
> success in leaving progeny

Darwin, in the course of his opus, did not merely lay out the voluminous
evidence for natural selection, he also frequently dropped hints of further
research to come: for instance, the topic of cooperation. As de Waal notes,
we're generally taught to think of Darwinism as survival of the strongest
individual competitors. Look at so-called "social Darwinism," and you'll see
something that Darwin would likely have hated. Because he clearly believed that
cooperation and education (an extension of "leaving progeny") were key
components of the general competition between traits (evolution) in a population
&mdash; that evolution is more than just my biceps are bigger than yours, my
brain case has more volume than yours, etc.
