Strange on the surface, but makes deep sense to me: currently reading Darwin's
_Origin of the Species_, and also started reading [Stories of
Baha'u'llah and Some Notable Early Believers](https://www.bahaiebooks.org/publications/storiesofbahaullahandsomenotablebelievers/) (Baha'u'llah is the
prophet-founder of the Baha'i Faith). Social-scientific evolution gives us a
Charles Darwin and social-religious evolution/God gives us the Manifestation of
the Cause of God for today. One brought us a better understanding of the
physical world, and the other a better understanding of the spiritual world
&mdash; and its implications for _how we live out our lives_ as sentient beings
in that physical world. Its implications for how we live amongst each other, for
how we treat that Nature, which Darwin so carefully analyzed and loved. For how
we reconcile ourselves to the seeming pointlessness of
the universe (dead link removed; SF 2025).
