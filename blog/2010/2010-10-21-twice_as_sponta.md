I'm not a spontaneous guy, so for me to do two spontaneous things, out of
schedule, in the same week, feels quite liberating! And it is a good reminder
that letting myself become too regimented is a sure sign that I'm being pulled
too far into the rat race, into the humdrum existence that I've always dreaded.
Building a trail and listening to Texas folk-rock are good cures for that.

This past weekend, I was in Missouri visiting my grandfather and my parents
(mostly the former since the latter then headed south to visit my sisters).
Monday morning, I was out hiking at Lake Springfield, on the new Greater Ozarks
Audubon Trail. Beautiful, lightly groomed trail, easily traversed. I encountered
blue jays, cardinals, carolina chickadees, carolina wrens, tufted titmouses,
downy woodpeckers, white-throated sparrows, and a red-headed woodpecker. Got out
of the woods into an open grassy area, looked down, and the trail seemed awfully
new. Rounded a corner, and it felt like I was in the opposite of Alice's woods
in Wonderland: there was a crew, digging up and grading a new trail. They asked
me to join, and after demurring for a few minutes, I decided to pitch in for 45
or so. Pulled up dozens of rocks and loosened the soil for a whole 12 feet. Now
I'm waiting for the group photo to show up on the [Volunteers for Outdoor Missouri](http://www.vfom.org) website.

Tonight I was to meet with someone who is interested in learning more about the
Baha'i Faith. I suppose we had some kind of miscommunication, as he didn't show.
Previously unbeknowst to me, there was to be a concert at the coffee shop that
night, with $10 cover. Ended up chatting with the musician for a few minutes, [Butch Morgan](http://www.butchmorgan.com/) from Devine, TX. Decided
that I should stay and listen to my fellow Texan, very far from my normal sad
routine. Good fun songs, folk/rock somewhat in the vein of what Steve Earle or
Willie would sound like if you scuffed them up a bit and made them drive to a
coffee shop in Minnesota. Good choice: good reward: good songs. He certainly
earned my last $10.
