It's about time. That was my first thought <a href=
"http://news.bahai.org/story/742">when I heard</a>, late last year, that the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; International Community had endorsed the [Interfaith Declaration on Climate
Change](http://www.interfaithdeclaration.org/). My next thought was: when will this trickle down to us, the people,
as a meaningful directive to change our habits? A few weeks ago, the National
Spiritual Assembly of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s of the United States sent a
letter to all American believers, calling their attention to the Declaration,
and to a <a href="http://www.bcca.org/ief/bic/bicccap.html">Seven Year Plan of
Action on Climate Change</a>. They encouraged us to actively incorporate
sustainable practices into our community life, in a manner more direct than ever
before.

Again: it's about time. But don't think that's a statement critical of
Bah&aacute;'&iacute; institutions. Rather, it's a statement about _the
Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s_. Many of us individually have tried to move our lives
closer to something sustainable (although as an American I'm still far from it).
Our communities are small, and our members incredibly active in a diverse
mixture of worship and service &mdash; particularly service in teaching all ages
about spiritual values for this day and age, service in working towards racial
and gender equality, service in direct action to help our neighbors and the
broader commumnity.

As a community, I suspect we simply weren't ready to take on this challenge. But
now we are, and our institutions have recognized it. It's about time we
strengthened our communities enough to take on the challenge of making changes
to address the imminent threat of climate change, and the suffering of humanity
and bio-diversity that it will entail.
