Sub-arctic winds blowing across the \
wide boulevard leaving crystalline \
mounds glinting and glistening as if \
all the stars in the heavens had \
fallen to the curb, no larger than \
they look from billions of miles away.

NaCL + (crystal) H20 -> salt flats \
that would make Utah proud, leaving \
car and shoe alike trembling \
with dread.

The sky is clear, the air crisp and \
pure, every color standing in sharpest \
relief against argent fields aground. \
That is, until the snow stops falling.

Day by day, what was white turns gray; \
and what was fresh, alive and bright, \
now is gritty, post-industrial blight. \
Then the magic flakes materialize \
again, wiping away the grime (or just \
covering it), flushing the soot from \
the air like a great Gaian sneeze.

Is that another 6 inches on the \
driveway? I'm staying in today.
