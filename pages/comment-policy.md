I welcome relevant and respectful comments. Off-topic, disrespectful, or abusive
comments will be removed. Which articles support comments, and for how long,
will be on a case-by-case basis as I try this out.

Before commenting, please consider reading about [Bah&aacute;&iacute;
consultation](https://bahaiteachings.org/what-is-bahai-consultation/), a
communal process for investigating truth while building a greater sense of
unity. Two of my favorite [quotes on
consultation](https://www.bahai.org/beliefs/universal-peace/articles-resources/consultation-quotes):

> "The Great Being saith: The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two
> luminaries of consultation and compassion. Take ye counsel together in all
> matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of guidance which leadeth the
> way, and is the bestower of understanding."
>
> ~ Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, _Tablets of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h_, Lawh-i-MaqsÃºd

> Say: no man can attain his true station except through his justice. No power
> can exist except through unity. No welfare and no well-being can be attained
> except through consultation.
>
> ~ Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, from a Tablet, translated from the Arabic
