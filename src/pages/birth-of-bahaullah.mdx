  <h1 class="text--center"> Commemorating the Birth of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h</h1>

  Today we are celebrating the second of the Twin Holy days in the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;
  calendar: the birth of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h, founder of the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith, in 1817.
  Yesterday we celebrated the birth of the B&aacute;b, born in 1819, who as an
  independent messenger from God both declared a new religion as a break from
  Islam, and prophesied that another, greater revelation would come soon after
  His own. Both were born in Persia, which is today known as Iran. In the lunar
  calendar used by the Muslim world, their births fell on consecutive days.
  Consequently, Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s around the world celebrate them as the "TWin Holy Days".

  The following is a brief excerpt from a talk given by Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h&#39;s eldest son,
  &#x201B;Abdu&#39;l-Bah&aacute;, that helps us learn more about His Father as a real person who
  lived and breathed in the nineteenth century:

  <div class="alert alert--secondary quote">
    “The Blessed Perfection, Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h, belonged to the nobility of Persia. From
    earliest childhood He was distinguished among His relatives and friends. They
    said, “This child has extraordinary power.” In wisdom, intelligence and as a
    source of new knowledge, He was advanced beyond His age and superior to His
    surroundings. All who knew Him were astonished at His precocity. It was usual
    for them to say, “Such a child will not live,” for it is commonly believed that
    precocious children do not reach maturity. During the period of youth the
    Blessed Perfection did not enter school. He was not willing to be taught. This
    fact is well established among the Persians of Tihran. Nevertheless, He was
    capable of solving the difficult problems of all who came to Him. In whatever
    meeting, scientific assembly or theological discussion He was found, He became
    the authority of explanation upon intricate and abstruse questions presented.

    Until His father passed away, Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h did not seek position or political
    station notwithstanding His connection with the government. This occasioned
    surprise and comment. It was frequently said, “How is it that a young man of
    such keen intelligence and subtle perception does not seek lucrative
    appointments? As a matter of fact, every position is open to him.” This is an
    historical statement fully attested by the people of Persia.

    He was most generous, giving abundantly to the poor. None who came to Him were
    turned away. The doors of His house were open to all. He always had many guests.
    This unbounded generosity was conducive to greater astonishment from the fact
    that He sought neither position nor prominence. In commenting upon this His
    friends said He would become impoverished, for His expenses were many and His
    wealth becoming more and more limited. “Why is he not thinking of his own
    affairs?” they inquired of each other; but some who were wise declared, “This
    personage is connected with another world; he has something sublime within him
    that is not evident now; the day is coming when it will be manifested.” In
    truth, the Blessed Perfection was a refuge for every weak one, a shelter for
    every fearing one, kind to every indigent one, lenient and loving to all
    creatures.

    He became well-known in regard to these qualities before the B&aacute;b appeared. Then
    Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h declared the B&aacute;b&#39;s mission to be true and promulgated His teachings.
    The B&aacute;b announced that the greater Manifestation would take place after Him and
    called the Promised One “Him Whom God shall make manifest,” saying that nine
    years later the reality of His own mission would become apparent.”

    He is the Most Holy, the Most Great.

    This is the month wherein was born He Who beareth the Most Great Name, Whose
    appearance hath caused the limbs of humankind to quake and the dust of Whose
    footsteps the Concourse on high and the dwellers of the cities of names have
    sought for a blessing. Whereupon they rendered praise unto God and cried out in
    joy and exultation. By God! This is the month through which all other months
    have been illumined, the month wherein He Who is the Hidden Secret and the
    Well-guarded Treasure hath been made manifest and hath called aloud amidst all
    humankind. All dominion belongeth to this newborn Child through Whom the face of
    creation hath been wreathed in smiles, and the trees have swayed, and the oceans
    have surged, and the mountains have taken flight, and Paradise hath lifted its
    voice, and the Rock hath cried out, and all things have exclaimed, “O concourse
    of creation! Hasten ye towards the dawning-place of the countenance of your
    Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate!”

    This is the month wherein Paradise itself was decked forth with the splendours
    of the countenance of its Lord, the All-Merciful, and the heavenly Nightingale
    warbled its melody upon the Divine Lote-Tree, and the hearts of the favoured
    ones were filled with rapture.

    O peoples of the world! The Sun of Truth hath risen to illumine the whole
    earth, and to spiritualize the community of man. Laudable are the results and
    the fruits thereof, abundant the holy evidences deriving from this grace. This
    is mercy unalloyed and purest bounty; it is light for the world and all its
    peoples; it is harmony and fellowship, and love and solidarity; indeed it is
    compassion and unity, and the end of foreignness; it is the being at one, in
    complete dignity and freedom, with all on earth.

    My God, my Adored One, my King, my Desire! What tongue can voice my thanks to
    Thee? I was heedless, Thou didst awaken me. I had turned back from Thee, Thou
    didst graciously aid me to turn towards Thee. I was as one dead, Thou didst
    quicken me with the water of life. I was withered, Thou didst revive me with the
    heavenly stream of Thine utterance which hath flowed forth from the Pen of the
    All-Merciful.

    O Divine Providence! All existence is begotten by Thy bounty; deprive it not of
    the waters of Thy generosity, neither do Thou withhold it from the ocean of Thy
    mercy. I beseech Thee to aid and assist me at all times and under all
    conditions, and seek from the heaven of Thy grace Thine ancient favor. Thou art,
    in truth, the Lord of bounty, and the Sovereign of the kingdom of eternity.

    ¡Mi Dios, mi Adorado, mi Rey, mi Deseo! ¿Qué lengua puede expresar mis gracias a
    Ti? Yo era negligente, Tú me despertaste. Yo me había apartado de Ti, Tú me
    ayudaste bondadosamente a volverme hacia Ti. Yo era como un muerto, Tú me
    hiciste revivir con el agua de vida. Yo estaba marchito, Tú me reanimaste con la
    corriente celestial de Tu Palabra, que ha brotado de la Pluma del
    Todomisericordioso.

    ¡Oh divina Providencia! Toda la existencia es engendrada por Tu munificencia; no
    le niegues las aguas de Tu generosidad ni la prives del océano de Tu
    misericordia. Te imploro que me ayudes y me asistas en todo momento y en toda
    condición, y anhelo Tu antiguo favor del cielo de Tu gracia. Tú eres, en verdad,
    el Señor de la munificencia y el Soberano del reino de la eternidad.

  <h2 class="text--center">Tablet of Visitation</h2>

  <div class="alert alert--primary quote">
    The praise which hath dawned from Thy most august Self, and the glory which hath
    shone forth from Thy most effulgent Beauty, rest upon Thee, O Thou Who art the
    Manifestation of Grandeur, and the King of Eternity, and the Lord of all who are
    in heaven and on earth!  I testify that through Thee the sovereignty of God and
    His dominion, and the majesty of God and His grandeur, were revealed, and the
    Daystars of ancient splendor have shed their radiance in the heaven of Thine
    irrevocable decree, and the Beauty of the Unseen hath shone forth above the
    horizon of creation.  I testify, moreover, that with but a movement of Thy Pen
    Thine injuction “Be Thou” hath been enforced, and God's hidden Secret hath been
    divulged, and all created things have been called into being, and all the
    Revelations have been sent down.

    I bear witness, moreover, that through Thy beauty the beauty of the Adored One
    hath been unveiled, and through Thy face the face of the Desired One hath shone
    forth, and that through a word from Thee Thou hast decided between all created
    things, causing them who are devoted to Thee to ascend unto the summit of glory,
    and the infidels to fall into the lowest abyss.

    I bear witness that he who hath known Thee hath known God, and he who hath
    attained unto Thy presence hath attained unto the presence of God.  Great,
    therefore, is the blessedness of him who hath believed in Thee, and in Thy
    signs, and hath humbled himself before Thy sovereignty, and hath been honored
    with meeting Thee, and hath attained the good pleasure of Thy will, and circled
    around Thee, and stood before Thy throne.  Woe betide him that hath transgressed
    against Thee, and hath denied Thee, and repudiated Thy signs, and gainsaid Thy
    sovereignty, and risen up against Thee, and waxed proud before Thy face, and
    hath disputed Thy testimonies, and fled from Thy rule and Thy dominion, and been
    numbered with the infidels whose names have been inscribed by the fingers of Thy
    behest upon Thy holy Tablets.

    Waft, then, unto me, O my God and my Beloved, from the right hand of Thy mercy
    and Thy loving-kindness, the holy breaths of Thy favors, that they may draw me
    away from myself and from the world unto the courts of Thy nearness and Thy
    presence.  Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.  Thou, truly, hast been
    supreme over all things.

    The remembrance of God and His praise, and the glory of God and His splendor,
    rest upon Thee, O Thou Who art His Beauty!  I bear witness that the eye of
    creation hath never gazed upon one wronged like Thee.  Thou wast immersed all
    the days of Thy life beneath an ocean of tribulations.  At one time Thou wast in
    chains and fetters; at another Thou wast threatened by the sword of Thine
    enemies.  Yet, despite all this, Thou didst enjoin upon all men to observe what
    had been prescribed unto Thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

    May my spirit be a sacrifice to the wrongs Thou didst suffer, and my soul be a
    ransom for the adversities Thou didst sustain.  I beseech God, by Thee and by
    them whose faces have been illumined with the splendors of the light of Thy
    countenance, and who, for love of Thee, have observed all whereunto they were
    bidden, to remove the veils that have come in between Thee and Thy creatures,
    and to supply me with the good of this world and the world to come.  Thou art,
    in truth, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving,
    the Most Compassionate.

    Bless Thou, O Lord my God, the Divine Lote-Tree and its leaves, and its boughs,
    and its branches, and its stems, and its offshoots, as long as Thy most
    excellent titles will endure and Thy most august attributes will last.  Protect
    it, then, from the mischief of the aggressor and the hosts of tyranny.  Thou
    art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.  Bless Thou, also, O Lord my
    God, Thy servants and Thy handmaidens who have attained unto Thee.  Thou, truly,
    art the All-Bountiful, Whose grace is infinite.  No God is there save Thee, the
    Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.
