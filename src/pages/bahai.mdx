Way back in 1995, I was in the right place at the right time to create one of
the first English-language (probably any language) websites on the [Bahá'í
Faith](https://www.bahai.org), initially for the Bahá'í Student Association of
the University of North Texas. In 1997, this became "Spirit of Glory: The Bahá'í
Faith", with a collection of themed images and texts that I had managed to
format in HTML. As others took this work much, much further (and often much,
much more elegantly), eventually I retired the site.
