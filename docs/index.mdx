        `safnet.com` has been Stephen A. Fuqua's online home since 1998,
        succeeding earlier University accounts dating to 1995.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Professionally](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenfuqua/), Stephen is
        a software engineer and open source advocate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephen is a member of the [Bahá'í Faith](https://www.bahai.org) and
        tries to infuse its principles of unity in diversity, equality,
        consultation, and more into practice in all aspects of life. Currently,
        he serves on the board of the [South Central Regional Training
        Institute](https://www.southcentralrti.org), an agency that oversees
        spiritual education programs for all ages in the four-state area of
        Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. He has been an active
        participant and facilitator of faith-based advocacy on topics of climate
        change, biodiversity, and interfaith cooperation and understanding.

      <p>
        He is also passionate about enjoying and protecting the natural world,
        with special interests in birds and the food webs they rely on (plants,
        insects). You may notice that he's easily distracted by movement of
        small creatures in trees and grasses

        "If the learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to allow mankind
        to inhale the fragrance of fellowship and love, every understanding
        heart would apprehend the meaning of true liberty, and discover the
        secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure."
