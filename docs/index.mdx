                Stephen is a member of the [Bahá'í Faith](https://www.bahai.org)
                and tries to infuse its principles of unity in diversity,
                equality, consultation, and more into practice in all aspects of
                life. Currently, he serves on the board of the [South Central
                Regional Training Institute](https://www.southcentralrti.org),
                an agency that oversees spiritual education programs for all
                ages in the four-state area of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
                and Texas. He has also been an active participant and
                facilitator of faith-based advocacy on topics of climate change,
                biodiversity, and interfaith cooperation and understanding.

                He is also passionate about enjoying and protecting the natural
                world, with special interests in birds and the food webs they
                rely on (plants, insects). You may notice that he's easily
                distracted by movement of small creatures in trees and grasses
