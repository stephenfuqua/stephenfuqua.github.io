_Love God Heal Earth_ is a compilation of essays, from leaders of 11 religions
and denominations, that delve into the religious call for a transition to a
sustainable way of life. While not devoid of science, this  book presents a
deeply spiritual, personal, and hopeful message that moves beyond the
intellectual reality of global climate change. In other words, it is a powerful
complement to the grim facts of _An Inconvenient Truth_.

Rev. Bingham assembled the author list from among her contacts in the network of
state-level Interfaith Power and Light organizations, of which her California
group was the first (and her Regeneration Project is the "umbrella"). These
authors are all active in promoting a lower impact way of life, in teaching
about climate change, and in encouraging an ethic of "creation care." They come
from diverse backgrounds, representing Buddhism, Christianity (in multiple
forms), Islam, Judaism, and Unitarianism. But their diversity is more than just
religious. One of the most striking aspects to this book is seeing how these
authors navigated from the traditional cares of their communities, which tend to
see conservation as at best someone else's job, into the field of creation care.

In that regard, I was particularly inspired by Rev. Dr. Gerald Durley, pastor of
the Providence Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta. He describes how his
passion for racial justice in America was suddenly transformed into an awareness
of ecological impacts on communities &mdash; an awareness of _eco-justice_. "The
light is on and it must continue to shine in all of our lives, to let us see
that most living things are being harmed because we are not aware nor globally
concerned about what it will take to save the environment," Rev. Durley writes.
My copy of the book is riddled with little pink sticky notes. His chapter has
none, because there was nothing I wanted to single out. It is an entire essay I
will return to often.

Those sticky notes mark out dozens of resources, ideas, and inspiring passages.
These will be of great help to anyone wishing to engage in religiously-motivated
action for the betterment of the planet. That action might be in the form of
political activism, or of intra-denominational or ecumenical _eco-theology_. You
will find inspiration here. If you find yourself wanting to change more than
just light bulbs (although that is a good start), you will find inspiration. If
your wish is to envision a life less-mired in materialism, or one that steps
boldly beyond the critics on left (anti-religion) and right
(anti-environmentalism), then you too will find a muse.

In closing this review, I share a passage from the Rev. Jim Deming, United
Church of Christ, Nashville, TN (p 49), which leaves me with a feeling of
realism, but also of hope.

> There will be times of backsliding and confession, but there will also be
> times of grace and insight that are God's reward for doing justice, loving
> kindness, and walking humbly _with_ our God. Let us humbly _invite_ our
> neighbor and walk _humbly_ to the future together.
