More than merely a memoir, _Portals to Freedom_ by Howard Colby Ives is both a
loving portrait of a "holy man" and a deeply personal exploration of the slow
convergence between intellectualism and spirituality. Ives, a former Unitarian
minister, wrote Portals to Freedom nearly eighty years ago. His aim was to
recount his experiences, still vivid 25 years after the fact, of sitting "at the
feet of the master" in a nearly literal sense &mdash; that is, of spending time
in the company of &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;, head of the
Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Faith from his father&rsquo;s death in 1892 until his
own in 1921. In various cultural terms, you might call him a holy man, a guru, a
saint; Bah&aacute;&rsquo;is simply call him "the Master."

&lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;, then approaching 70 years old, journeyed to
North America in 1912 to strengthen the faith of those who already embraced his
father&rsquo;s religion, and to acquaint new audiences with its teachings. Ives
had been introduced to the religion by friends shortly before
&lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;&rsquo;s arrival in New York City. He makes plain
that he had a sort of intellectual attraction to the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;i
teachings, as a liberal theologian, but it did not initially extend to
consideration of the personal implications. The question of personal faith
slowly dawned on him, as he recounts in a number of poignantly narrated
encounters with &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; in parlors and audience-halls.

Ives is an excellent writer. Of course some of his phraseology does not quite
fit the modern language, but he is never difficult to read. He has an
orrator&lsquo;s flair that keeps the work from becoming too dry &mdash; as does
&lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;&rsquo;s humor, displayed in several of the
stories of him. That Ives is well-trained in matters of religion, philosophy,
and the scientific currents of the day is abundantly clear.

It is also clear that this training becomes a source of confusion and disharmony
in his life, once he has encountered &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;. For
instance, one of his stories speaks of his deep need to understand the word
"renunciation" in the phrase "horizon of renunciation." When asked, the Master
provides a commentary on "horizon" instead, thus leading to an initial sense of
disappointment. Knowing somewhat of the spiritual significance of
renunciation/detachment, the reader (and eventually the author) can plainly see
how &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; was teaching by example and implication. The
full story of that encounter naturally reveals far more than this soundbite, and
it is but one of many that beautifully illustrate
&lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;&rsquo;s mode of being.

The author&rsquo;s spiritual journey is presented as a lesson to share with
others, but there remains an appropriate humility about it: for the most part,
the book is autobiographical just to the extent that it explains Ives&rsquo;
motivation and frame of mind throughout his experience, which necessarily shaped
the questions he asked and the stories to took note of. By the time of
&lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;&rsquo;s return to Palestine, Ives has managed a
rapprochement between his intellectual and spiritual natures, in a manner
reminiscent of the struggles Tolstoy documents in his _Confessions_. He
expresses the conflict  in these terms in the book&rsquo;s conclusion:

> "Scholasticism provides no answer to the demands of men for a satisfaction of
> those primal needs of the spirit. Religion, as generally understood &mdash;
> being, as it is, a mixture of tradition, social convention, and more or less
> correct estimates of the immediate problems confronting people, and all
> savored with a salt that has lost its savor &mdash; provides no satisfaction
> to the hungry souls of men. In all this confusion of thought and action, no
> rock is found upon which many may plant his spiritual feet and be confident in
> his treading."

Religion, in the form of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Faith as opposed to
"generally understood," still has the power to recharge &mdash; to "salt" the
"salt of the earth," he discovered.

Those seeking to know &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; better, to emulate his
ways and appreciate the beauty and truth of the teachings he explicated, will be
referring back to this work for centuries to come. All who seek to escape
cynicism, or to reconcile the western intellectual tradition with a religious
worldview, would do well to follow Ives&rsquo; transformation, and to ponder and
then put into action the meaning of the stories he relates.
