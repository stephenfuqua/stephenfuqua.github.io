We're now 85% unpacked, though the place is still a mess. Just got library cards
and using a public library Internet Station for the first time ever, very
exciting you know. So if anyone's reading, other than the viagra and cialis
spam-bots (they flood old blog entries with spurious spam comments), drop me a
line and say hello. My Austin mobile number is still good. If you don't have it,
send me an e-mail. Oh, and the weather has been gorgeous =).
