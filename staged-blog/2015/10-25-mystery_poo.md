Who did this? Who would leave such mighty poo below my bell pepper? Our fence is too tight for rabbits...

It is a tobacco hornworm!

And another!

Three there were on Wednesday<br>
(That could be seen, anyway),<br>
Leaving a mighty mess.<br>
Three were joined by five today,<br>
Eating tomatoes in excess.<br>
Bell peppers they devoured,<br>
Undaunted by the showers<br>
Of the record rains.<br>
Were it spring,<br>
I would complain,<br>
And hold them all at bay.<br>
But here in fall,<br>
I do not mind &mdash;<br>
Let them eat away!<br>
