I've started a new project on CodePlex, called [Reggie](http://reggie.codeplex.com/), and posted the initial working
source code. Reggie's goal is to be a simple developer tool for writing and
testing Regular Expressions. It is inspired by the venerable Regulator tool and
will be created in WPF using the MVVM pattern.
